<p>Mixed integer linear programing is easy to comprehend on the surface, you just plug in
a linear constraint and voila! you now have transformed a LP into a MIP. Learning how to
systematically write a model with its constraints and component is, sadly, a matter
of training. Watching all these professors and these seniors formulate constraints at ease makes
it look easy, which may or may note evoke an air of imposter syndrom.</p>

<p>Just like coding, the goal is to shape the perspective around optimization, that's the passive
effect of doing exercises. Some of the constraints seem intuitive but once you get into the deeper
side of linear programming (I.E. Big M, logical constraints...etc..), it becomes a bit hard to visualize the effect
of a constraint with respect to the optimization problem that you are facing.</p>


<p>This article is aimed at introducing the method that I use to understand a linear constraint.
This method is sadly not directly communicated, as it is to be concluded through intuition and can not be
easily googled, as the average Operational research guide or blog expects the person to have some mathematical
reflexes.</p>
