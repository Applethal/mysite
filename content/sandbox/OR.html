<p>Mixed integer linear programing is easy to comprehend on the surface, you just plug in
a linear constraint and voila! you now have transformed a LP into a MIP. Learning how to
systematically write a model with its constraints and component is, sadly, a matter
of training. Watching all these professors and these seniors formulate constraints at ease makes
it look easy, which may or may note evoke an air of imposter syndrom.</p>

<p>Just like coding, the goal is to shape the perspective around optimization, that's the passive
effect of doing exercises. Some of the constraints seem intuitive but once you get into the deeper
side of linear programming (I.E. Big M, logical constraints...etc..), it becomes a bit hard to visualize the effect
of a constraint with respect to the optimization problem that you are facing.</p>


<p>This article is aimed at introducing the method that I use to understand a linear constraint.
This method is sadly not directly communicated, as it is to be concluded through intuition and can not be
easily googled, as the average Operational research guide or blog expects the person to have some mathematical
reflexes. This method is meant to be fool-proof, I believe that no one may face difficulties with it.</p>


<p>Unless relaxed, binary variables express the execution of a decision; if the variable equals 1,
the decision to execute what the variable expresses is enabled. Do you produce X, do you use X, do you allocate X...etc...
</p>


\[
X=\begin{cases}
1 & \text{Decision is to be executed}\\
0 & \text{Otherwise}
\end{cases}
\]


<p>When writing mathematical models, it is imperative to express linear functions (hence the term Linear in the model's property). Many modelling
tricks were invented to cope with constraints that can not be directly translated from a verbal statement. Allow me to present the following modelling
trick:	</p>


\[
x \leq y

\]


\[
If Product X is produced, I want Product Y to be produced alongside it. However, I still want the option to decide on producing Product Y independently of whether Product X gets produced.
x, y \in [0,1]
\]


<p>This trick helps to formulate situations where the execution of a variable (in this case \(x\)) forces another variable (\(y\)) to be true, though we don't
care about the latter, we want to force them both to be enabled if the former gets the value of 1. In other words: </p>


<ul>
<li> If x = 1 then y = 1
<li> If x = 0 then we don't care if y = 1 or 0
</ul>

<p><u>Concret example: </u>If Product X is produced, I want Product Y to be produced alongside it. However, I still want the option to decide on producing Product Y independently of whether Product X gets produced.</p>

<p>How could I understand the desired outcome of this expression ? Before presenting the method, let me explain how this whole thing works: <br>

From a logical point of view, the
