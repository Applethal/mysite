<p>The circuits in the article were all made in <a href="https://www.rustrician.io/">Rustician website</a>. The XML code
  of each circuit can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/Applethal/rust_circuits">Repo</a>.</p>

<p>I have a love and hate relationship with the creative side of <a
    href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/Rust/">Rust</a>. I dedicated a huge chunk of my time into its
  creative side rather than its core loop. I recently got into its electrical programming and learned about how fun it
  is to solve lots of niche problems and even optimize many workflows using logic. My very favourite part in all of
  this, is that I never had any prior knowledge in the area of electrical engineering, yet I could manage to grasp many
  concepts using nothing but knowledge taken from discrete mathematics.</p>

<p>The reason behind the making of this repo is to have my own space where I can store circuits that me and a couple of
  friends have made. I will try to describe the story behind the making of each circuit from the perspective of a
  non-engineer.</p>


<h2>One power source source powering multiple batteries. Author: Me</h2>

<p>2 days ago as of the writing of this article, I have had the idea of one power source that fills multiple batteries
  instead of having one source for each battery, what spawned this desire was my realization that batteries have a port
  that passes a signal when the battery reports having full capacity. My very first thought was to use a couple of OR
  switches, only to realize that an XOR switch has only one output. Basically all the logical gates take up to 2 inputs
  and have only 1 output port. I kept digging through the options at my disposal and found out that I could use a memory
  cell, which can be compared to a switch in your living room that delivers power to 1 out of 2 light bulbs, think of it
  as a XOR but with 2 output. After toying a lot with this item, I came up with this circuit:
</p>

  <p style="color: #888; font-size: 14px;">One power source circuit with 2 batteries</p>
</div>

<p>What this circuit does is simple: When the cell is set to 0 (initial state), power is delivered to the first battery,
  when the battery fully loads, it signals the memory cell to deliver the power to the next battery by turning setting
  the memory cell to 1, by the time that one loads, power is delivered again to the first battery using the same logic.
  This can by the way be further optimized by removing the branches and connect everything using 1 memory cells for
  maximum juice because these use 0 Watts and deliver all the power delivered to them.</p>

</div>

<p>A good friend of mine then declared that we may try harder and add support for more than 2 batteries. This was
  somewhat challenging, especially for a rookie like me.
  Throughout my tries, I learned that the memory cell keeps its state even when receiving no power. I could not find any
  examples online of such scheme,
  especially since the very few who have the knowledge necessary, are sadly more invested in building defense focused
  circuits.
  I later noticed that a memory cell accepts logic allowing it to reset its state back to 0, after some brainstorming, I
  came up with this:</p>



<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/rust_circuits/Battery/morebatteries.png">
  <p style="color: #888; font-size: 14px;">Support for more batteries added!</p>
</div>

<p>The best I could do is to sequentially charge each battery one by one, simply put, given a set of battery \(B\), a
  battery will start charging only when its predecessor is fully charged. The receipt for this whole circuit demands a
  memory cell
  for each battery, and an electrical branch for each 2 batteries. The splitter at the end can be substituted with a
  couple of branches for more efficiency since resetting the cells requires only 1 Watt anyways.
  In this example a splitter was used because I had 3 batteries to work with. When all the batteries are fully charged,
  the memory cell states will keep resetting back to 0 to ensure that the loop will never stop.</p>

  <p style="color: #888; font-size: 14px;">Support for more batteries added! - Improved</p>
</div>

<p>This reverse root combiner system may be used for multiple purposes I suppose. I see it being used potentially for
  defensive purposes where each battery will act as a tool to power-up the turrets of a given floor when a detection
  logic is triggered for instance. The main core of this build is to have a
  proper backup system which ensures that energy flow is distributed to multiple storage containers without having to
  invest too much on multiple power sources, I have seen people installing a wind turbine for each battery, which
  honestly takes up lots of space.</p>


<h2>Tesla trap + door state reset . Author: Me + a friend </h2>


<p>I'll keep things short in here, we essentially wanted a circuit that traps lured people after they enter a specific
  room. Simply put, once the player enters the room, the door shuts off and a tesla coil starts running until the person
  perishes. Achieving this is quite easy, as all it takes is a pressure pad that conducts electricity to a branch that
  goes
  to the door controller and the tesla coil. The difficult part however is to reset the state of the circuit, making it
  so that
  the end result is to have the doors being opened again. I spent some time trying to do this using a memory cell, I
  realized that
  there is no way to use the pressure pad alone to trigger any electrical logic, it can only fire up if it takes an
  input, nor that the door controllers' states get reset after receiving 0 power. At first I thought I could use the
  heartbeat sensor but it suffers from the same design shenanigans. My friend
  and I somehow
  made it work using a XOR gate where we set a default state of having the doors open, the XOR gate was the key all
  along, as once we make it so that it
  receives power from both a power source and a branch predeceased by a pressure pad, we ensure that
  the tesla coils and the door mechanism won't switch to its intended active state unless a player steps on it.
