Summary: A small repo where I will keep some fancy electrical circuits

<h3>Disclaimer:</h3><p>The circuits in the article were all made in<a href="https://www.rustrician.io/">Rustician website</a>. The XML code of each circuit can be found in my <a href="https://github.com/Applethal/rust_circuits">Repo</a>.</p>

<p>I have a love and hate relationship with the creative side of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/Rust/">Rust</a>. I dedicated a huge chunk of my time into its creative side rather than its core loop. I recently got into its electrical programming and learned about how fun it is to solve lots of niche problems and even optimize many workflows using logic. My very favourite part in all of this, is that I never had any prior knowledge in the area of electrical engineering, yet I could manage to grasp many concepts using nothing but knowledge taken from discrete mathematics.</p>

<p>The reason behind the making of this repo is to have my own space where I can store circuits that me and a couple of friends have made. I will try to describe the story behind the making of each circuit from the perspective of a non-engineer.</p>


<h2>One power source source powering multiple batteries. Author: Saad Nordine</h2>

<p>2 days ago as of the writing of this article, I have had the idea of one power source that fills multiple batteries instead of having one source for each battery, what spawned this desire was my realization that batteries have a port that passes a signal when the battery reports having full capacity. My very first thought was to use a couple of OR switches, only to realize that an XOR switch has only one output. Basically all the logical gates take up to 2 inputs and have only 1 output port. I kept digging through the options at my disposal and found out that I could use a memory cell, which can be compared to a switch in your living room that delivers power to 1 out of 2 light bulbs, think of it as a XOR but with 2 output. After toying a lot with this item, I came up with this circuit:
</p>

  <p style="color: #888; font-size: 14px;">One power source circuit with 2 batteries</p>
</div>

<p>What this circuit does is simple: When the cell is set to 0 (initial state), power is delivered to the first battery, when the battery fully loads, it signals the memory cell to deliver the power to the next battery by turning setting the memory cell to 1, by the time that one loads, power is delivered again to the first battery using the same logic. This can by the way be further optimized by removing the branches and connect everything using 1 memory cells for maximum juice because these use 0 Watts and deliver all the power delivered to them.</p>

</div>

<p>A good friend of mine then declared that we may try harder and add support for more than 2 batteries. This was somewhat challenging, especially for a rookie like me. Throughout my tries, I learned that the memory cell keeps its state even when receiving no power, so using a blocker was not an option. I could not find any examples online of such scheme, especially since the very few who have the knowledge necessary, are sadly more invested in building defense focused circuits. I later noticed that a memory cell accepts logic allowing it to reset its state back to 0, after some brainstorming, I came up with this:</p>



<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/rust_circuits/morebatteries.png">
  <p style="color: #888; font-size: 14px;">Support for more batteries added!</p>
</div>

<p>The best I could do is to sequentially charge each battery one by one, simply put, given a set of battery \(B\), a battery will start charging only when its predecessor is fully charged. This presents itself as a major flaw in the system, as the logic won't loop unless the first or the last batteries begin to charge, if anything beside those loses power, it won't receive power unless the aforementioned batteries are fully loaded. The receipt for this whole circuit demands a memory cell for each battery, and an electrical branch for each move. The splitter at the end can be substituted with a couple of branches for more efficiency since resetting the cells requires only 1 Watt anyways. In this example a splitter was used because I had 3 batteries to work with, you will then need a way for each memory cell to reset simultaneously. As of yet, I would say that the first and last batteries should always be used for heavy workload to ensure continuous power flow for all the other batteries, whilst the latter should have the least amount of workload to prevent shutdowns in a process.</p>
