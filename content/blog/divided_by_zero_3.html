<p>Communicating is the gift that acts as a bridge linking the human with its needs. Being able to comprehend context is a sign of intelligence, and being able to transmit information and participating in a discussion proves even greater intelligence. I believe this ability is what seperates us from zombies; it is a common trope in the works of fiction to label these creatures with some form of idiocy, as their ability to communicate is limited to reception only. <br> In <a href="https://applethal.com/blog/divided_by_zero_2/"> one of my previous articles</a>, I mentioned that communication is in the far ends of the complexity spectrum, but as of yet, I lack the qualifications to prove it or even validate this fact. </p>


<p>Human communication is a skill that can be represented through the following venn diagramm. The verbal communication is what everyone sees and hears, and the non-verbal communication is what carries emotions and anything that contains little to no syntax. It adds flavour to the delivered context, and may even reshape its meaning. I believe human communication underwent lots of changes in the non-verbal part, and the more I age, the more flavours I keep discovering. I sadly can not make a concret comparison, as I was born in the 90's and had little exposer to my human peers, but most of the elders that I spoke with expressed some validation in this matter.  </p>

            <script type="text/tikz">
            \begin{tikzpicture}

    \tikzset{set/.style={circle, minimum size=3cm, draw, thick}}

    \node[set, label=left:Verbal] (A) at (0,0) {};
    \node[set, label=right:Non-Verbal] (B) at (2.5,0) {};


    \node at (1.25, -2) {Communication};

<p>The non-verbal side here can not sadly be taught and transfered directly, this is especially true due to the nature of what makes a human. The fact that human communication is complex can be backed up in a statistical fashion, if you try to hold a short conversation with 10 different people on the same subject, depending on the subject of course, one may not receive the same outcomes and responses from these people. The way they react is (re)shaped through their psychology, which is begins to form itself since their birth.</p>


<p>I sadly struggle with the transmitting and receiving non-verbal communication, to the point that I may spend extra time just to process and decide on how to respond to the question "How are you?". Because of this anomaly, I end up confusing the average person, making them spend some extra effort into guessing my emotions; which may result in various interesting outcomes. Some people have had difficulties distinguishing whether what I said was serious or not, this is because people like to believe what seems average to them and only a few, from my own experience, would validate what I say. This is mentally-taxing because some of what  </p>
