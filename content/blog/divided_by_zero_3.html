<p>Communicating is the gift that acts as a bridge linking the human with its needs. Being able to comprehend context is
    a sign of intelligence, and being able to transmit information and participating in a discussion proves even greater
    cognition. I believe this ability is what separates us from zombies; it is a common trope in the works of fiction to
    label these creatures with some form of idiocy, as their ability to communicate is limited to reception only. <br>
    In <a href="https://applethal.com/blog/divided_by_zero_2/"> one of my previous articles</a>, I mentioned that
    communication is in the far ends of the complexity spectrum, but as of yet, I lack the qualifications to prove it or
    even validate this fact. </p>


<p>Although the previous paragraph hints towards speech as a medium, communication can be executed using many forms:
    Through visual art, gestures, music and more...Spoken human communication is a skill that can be represented through
    the following
    venn diagram. The verbal communication is what everyone sees and hears, and the non-verbal communication is what
    carries emotions and anything that contains little to no syntax. It depends on various elements such as the tone and
    body language. It adds flavour to the delivered context, and may even reshape its meaning. I believe human
    communication underwent lots of changes in the non-verbal part, and the more I age, the more flavours I keep
    discovering. I sadly can not make a concrete comparison - as I was born in the 90's and had little exposer to my
    human peers - but most of the elders that I spoke with expressed their confirmations in this matter. </p>


<div class="scroll-container">
    <div class="tikzs">
        <g transform>
            <script type="text/tikz">
            \begin{tikzpicture}

    \tikzset{set/.style={circle, minimum size=3cm, draw, thick}}

    \node[set, label=left:Verbal] (A) at (0,0) {};
    \node[set, label=right:Non-Verbal] (B) at (2.5,0) {};


    \node at (1.25, -2) {Communication};

\end{tikzpicture}
          </script>
    </div>
    <p style="text-align:center; color:grey; font-size:14px;"> Communication venn diagram</p>
</div>

<p>The non-verbal side here can not sadly be taught and transferred directly, this is especially true due to the nature
    of what makes a human. The fact that human communication is complex can be backed using statistics, if you try to
    hold a short conversation with 10 different people on the same subject, depending on the subject of course, one may
    not observe the same outcomes and responses from these people. The way they react is mainly (re)shaped through their
    psychology, which is begins to form itself since their birth and influences their reactions.</p>


<p>I sadly struggle with the transmitting and receiving non-verbal communication, to the point that I may spend extra
    time just to process and decide on how to respond to the question "How are you?". Because of this anomaly, I end up
    confusing the average person, making them spend some extra effort into guessing my emotions; which may result in
    various interesting outcomes, and if I am playing the role of a receiver, I may sometimes lock myself out of sarcasm
    or jokes, making some people comment on how my brain wires could use more current. Some people have had difficulties
    distinguishing whether what I said was serious or not, this is because people like to believe what seems average to
    them and only a few, from my own experience, would validate what I say. This is mentally-taxing because some of what
    I express deviates from the average, and people's receptions of my endeavors may prevent me from having access to
    many opportunities like forming friendships and whatnot. One heuristic that I found working against such caveats is
    to tell people upfront -on day 1-
    that everything I say is serious and should not be taken as a joke; this way, I create a dynamic where I would not
    worry about transmitting false positives when speaking. Sadly, this approach shrinks my network, but at least it
    flourishes mutual comprehension.</p>



<p>Due to the aforementioned struggles, my mannerisms get compared to those of a robot. My ego gets damaged upon
    invalidation, explaining myself becomes then an unpaid job as I keep trying to find the right words and expressions
    for each person. I am super grateful when people receive me without questioning my legitimacy. But then, just as I
    wish to be validated quite often, I practice validation to create a fair experience for everyone, which may make me
    sometimes vulnerable to those with bad intentions. This latter example is one way for me to sympathize with those
    who face difficulties comprehending my speech in those times, since everyone these days could use a shield or two.
    There should be a balance somehow! Proof of this bottleneck can be observed when I have to converse with the average
    individuals; I get my facts denied upon verbally stating them, and when someone comes in and says the exact same
    facts with the same choice of words, they get validated. This often calls for the need to have an advocate of sorts
    that can help me transmit what I sometimes wish to say.</p>


<p>Emojis were created to facilitate these contextual transmissions, one has an emoji for pretty much any expression. I
    barely use emoticons, not that I don't like using them, but I always felt that what I write conveys enough
    information and having an emoji in my messages would bring me no emotional extras. As funny as it seems, this
    practice
    disregards what the receiving party feels when I send the texts; as of yet no one has complained to me on the
    matter.
    However, one great game changer that I have discovered in the last years, and wished if everyone would use it, is
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_indicator">tone indicator syntax</a>. It is a small list of "codes"
    that can be put at the end of a message to indicate the
    tone. I find these much more useful than emojis, because being able to contextually sense the person's tone allows
    me to delve a bit deeper in their layers. Of course I would not use these in a work environment since I take
    everything seriously, but in other settings, I find these much more helpful than emojis. Take for example the wink
    emoji 😉, this one expresses (by default) various meanings depending and may be misinterpreted by some, but if you
    attach one of the tone indicator codes at the end
    of a message, I can immediately recognize your intentions. Some people find these small additions silly, completely
    discarding alexithymia, which mechanically disallows anyone that suffers from it to easily navigate this world, I
    mean come on! It takes only a second or two to type one of the codes. <br> I lost many nodes in my social networks
    due to the fact
    that the other party misinterpreted my intentions and phantasied a couple of assumptions without even taking the
    time to ask about my them.</p>



<p>My ultimate wish, which can never be fulfilled in my opinion, is to live in a world where every context exchange is
    transparent and clear. This can never happen due to our imperfections as human beings. I am not too deep invested in
    Carl Jung's philosophies, but I believe it's a good start for my argument, as masking our shadow is one thing that
    contributes to our corruption. Just imagine if everyone was honest about their intentions, we probably would not
    need to seek templates on how to apologize, apply for a job, or tell someone that we love them. Ontologies are one
    way to establish a linguistic union between all entities, but I am not sure how we would reach such levels of
    understanding. I can only wish for such a world for now, as the best I can do is to encourage others to simplify
    their speech and be honest. I noticed that the average person complains about how their peers could not catch a
    hint, or how these HR people encountered someone who lied in their resume, yet I still see that these same people
    participate in this cycle, argumenting that it's, sadly, the only way to efficiently survive, in other words, I
    would have to play their games too if I want to reach what I want. As previously mentioned, my wish can never be
    fulfilled, unless we collectively work together on making it happen, everyone knows that this transformation is
    something that everyone is going to benefit from. I sense that capitalism is one thing encouraging this behavior,
    making almost all players prioritize their own benefits instead of working on a common cause, but I don't think I am
    ready for such a topic.</p>

<p>This blog post serves as more of a rant in comparison to the rest of the articles in my divided by zero series to say
    the least. Few months ago I had the chance to encounter people who promoted all the philosophies discussed so far.
    Being around these people made me open up, I somehow had this strange feeling, wishing if we all treated each other
    like this. Coincidently, I had a speech on the matter with my father, who had arguments corelating to religion,
    saying that the devil will always influence humans into seeking shortcuts, hence why those with diverging goals
    would always sugar coat their speech to attain their objectives. Deciphering tone costs processing time, if we are
    aware of this, why do we keep relying on others to catch hints? A set of youtubers, whose content I really enjoy
    listening to, just recently released similar videos on this specific matter, the majority had their videos
    containing a diagnose on why people act like this but proposed no rocket science solution. We all know creating a
    crystal clear ecosphere is the best for all parties, so what are we waiting for?</p>


<p>I genuinely dislike the fact that lying, independent from any form, is deemed to be rewarding, is encouraged and seen
    as a symbol of charisma. I can't deny that I have never committed similar acts, but I am positive that if I have had
    told the truth in all of my past experiences, all the interactions -and by extension what came after said
    interactions- that were subject to my lies would have had a better ending. Funnily enough, in the theory of
    designing a system of multi-AI agents, truth telling is deemed to be the best strategy in negotiating, because it
    allows the system to stay fail-proof against unexpected circumstances. I can sadly only day dream about living in
    such environment, I am sure in a different life, almost everything would be better under these parameters.</p>
