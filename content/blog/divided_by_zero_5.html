<p>Recently, I got in touch with someone I befriended rather quickly because of the similarities we shared. Through our conversations, I learned how the word “core” is jokingly used to describe the vibes or ideas that revolve around an entity. Online, it isn’t applied to every object or creation, nor does it serve as a substitute for “starter packs.” From my observations, those “core” videos present themselves as collections that capture what an entity offers, things that can’t easily be described with words. I thought maybe, just maybe, since I believe in cultural pipelines, I would write about my own inner core. This time, I’ll display the things I love, the passions I could talk about for hours. I’m not sure if this aligns with the internet’s use of the word “core,” but since this is my website, I feel free to define it in my own way.</p>
<p>Of course, this is one of those articles that will always remain a work in progress. You never know when I’ll develop new interests as I grow older. These reflect my inner core, the things I sometimes wish I could freely talk about every day. Usually, I share fragments of them depending on whether the other person would enjoy the topic or not. Still, I’ve also seen people share their passions regardless, simply for the sake of introducing others to what they love, independent of whether their peers are into it </p>

<h2>Animals</h2>

<p>I have difficulties deciding on a favourite animal. Sometimes you will see demonstrate love towards sables/pine martins, sometimes Tasmanian devils, but more often, you will see me say that I love crows. My love for sables began as I learned about their predatory nature which is hidden under their cute form; I was led to this end of the pipeline beginning with ferrets; sables are biological cousins of ferrets and due to the some factors, they are forbidden to have as pets, as far as the rules of Germany are concerned. I can't seem to perceive a pattern regarding the behaviour of crows, some people say they are friendly, some people say they may hate you for decades, but everyone agrees that they are intelligent in comparison to the average bird. I have seen clips of pet crows attempting to mimic human speech, a skill that I thought was exclusive to parrots. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/crow.diary/">one</a> of my favourite Instagram accounts is reserved for a Japanese lady who taught her crow to say "Ohayo!" (Japanese for hello!), "Gohan!" (Food in Japanese) and "Asobou!" (Let's play in Japanese). </p>
<p>I discovered capybara by the end of 2022 through one of the people that I am subscribed to. I like how peaceful and careless they are. One of my favourite quirks is how they may use other animals as transportation mediums, which looks even funnier when you may see a capybara ride a crocodile of all things, which made me learn that crocodiles would not eat these because they are too fat for their mouths to process. </p>

<h2>Fiction</h2>

<p> My problem with the average fiction might be a me problem, as I keep aging, it becomes increasingly harder and harder to attract me into many of the modern works. This is mainly since, I believe, we hit the creativity ceillings and that there isn't much left for us to remix from. I love fiction that comes with a twist, the type that surprises me with explanations to phenomena that remained mysterious from the very start. I noticed that what makes this writing more attractive is how some authors link it to Jungian concepts such as the self and the persona..etc. I just finished the first parts of the Yoko Taro's <a href="https://nier.fandom.com/wiki/NieR">Nier</a> and it left me stunned for days. </p>
<p>Aside from that, I do of course enjoy episodic fiction too, the type that has episode stories that are independent of each other, I believe these are meant to be consumed for the characters and visuals and not for the story. I like how these tend to challenge the design of building upon long plots and instead offering something fresh and new every day. These usually come in the form of sitcoms. I began enjoying a few that were produced in my country. Sadly the majority of what was made in the post 2010 started to have a decline in quality, leaving me no choice but to pray to have good Moroccan production. I sometimes feel grateful for being born in the right generation, I will always claim that media consumerism was good in my early age.</p>
