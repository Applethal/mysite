<p>Recently I got in touch with someone whom I befriended real quick due to some similarities we shared. Throughout our discussions, I learned how the word "core" is jokingly used to describe the vibes or ideas that circulate around an entity. Online, it is somewhat not utilized for every existing object or creation, and yet, it does not substitute "starter packs". From my observations, those "core" videos present themselves as a collection that summarize what the entity is offering, things that somehow can't easily be described with words. I thought maybe, just maybe, because I believe in cultural pipelines, I would write about my inner core, except this time, I will display the things that I love and like, things that I enjoy talking about for hours. I am not sure if this is the intent of using the word "core" as per the rules of the internet, but I believe this is my website and I am totally free to establish my freedom here.</p>
<p>Of course, this is one of those few articles that will always be subject to change. You never know if I end up developing love for newer things as I keep aging, naturally. These will concern my inner core, things that I sadly wish I could freely talk about every day. I usually share these fragment depending on whether the person would enjoy these or not, I have however seen people share them regardless for the sake of introducing others independently of what their peers are into. </p>

<h2>Animals</h2>

<p>I have difficulties deciding on a favourite animal. Sometimes you will see demonstrate love towards sables/pine martins, sometimes Tasmanian devils, but more often, you will see me say that I love crows. My love for sables began as I learned about their predatory nature which is hidden under their cute form; I was led to this end of the pipeline beginning with ferrets; sables are biological cousins of ferrets and due to the some factors, they are forbidden to have as pets, as far as the rules of Germany are concerned. I can't seem to perceive a pattern regarding the behaviour of crows, some people say they are friendly, some people say they may hate you for decades, but everyone agrees that they are intelligent in comparison to the average bird. I have seen clips of pet crows attempting to mimic human speech, a skill that I thought was exclusive to parrots. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/crow.diary/">one</a> of my favourite Instagram accounts is reserved for a Japanese lady who taught her crow to say "Ohayo!" (Japanese for hello!), "Gohan!" (Food in Japanese) and "Asobou!" (Let's play in Japanese). </p>
<p>I discovered capybara by the end of 2022 through one of the people that I am subscribed to. I like how peaceful and careless they are. One of my favourite quirks is how they may use other animals as transportation mediums, which looks even funnier when you may see a capybara ride a crocodile of all things, which made me learn that crocodiles would not eat these because they are too fat for their mouths to process. </p>
