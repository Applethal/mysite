Summary: I wish we had a different word for the expression "double-edged sword" as I prefer to use other weapons.

  Since my early years, I lived in an environment contained in a society where the best is meant to survive in the long
  term. As a child, my French teacher used to punish me for having poor writing by ripping off my paper and telling me
  to rewrite the texts, which were long and time-consuming by my standards back when I was a kid. Today, my handwriting
  is beautiful and praised by many, <b>but at what cost?</b>

  Perfectionism is something that many artists suffer from. You can’t help but accept it as being part of your
  production process, it eventually may lead to burnout. There are heuristics against it, but if you ask me, despite the
  outcomes, I like my final products! I like how I keep repairing the damages, fixing the errors, ensuring that what I
  present to the world is as shiny as what I foretold prior to its making. It is, however, interesting that it does not
  only affect my crafts, it plays a role in my conversations and interactions as well, as I often repeat myself upon
  wrong pronunciations. It often eats my time and makes me burn extra calories.
</p>
<p>
  I am aware of it as an enemy; it offers the end goal of being satisfied with my output at the cost of my mental
  health. Had I not submitted to it, you probably would never see most of my works. Sometimes, however, I give up due to
  technical limitations, though I try my best to achieve approximations. There is also the matter of setting goals; as a
  student, I had to write scientific works, and I always had difficulties determining what the professor is expecting
  from me in terms of quality. I often hear: “hey, you don’t have to spend that much effort”. The keyword here is
  “much”; you could say that I did not set a bar here, alas, I wish I received a list of detailed goals to checkmark, I
  disliked having this freedom in my writings, as it does not allow me to visualize what my person exactly wants
  quality-wise.
</p>
<p>
  There is also the matter of learning constraints, I hardly accept skipping pages unless I fully comprehend what’s
  inside, thinking that I might need to know it in the future pages. I suppose everyone goes through this out of exam
  fears.
</p>
<p>
  I never attempted to stop perfectionism, what I do however is slow it down since I am embracing it anyways, as it
  allows me to see the potential improvements that I can implement. Once I notice a flaw, if it’s not critical, I add it
  to my to-do list and reserve a week just to make the fixing. Speaking of planning, I get triggered when something
  outside my influence breaks my plan and causes anomalies in my flow, so there is that as well.
</p>
<p>
  And even when things are fully done and ready for release, there is always a nagging figure that keeps murmuring my
  head about potential improvements, so I keep pleasing it so to speak. Sometimes this may lead to what people call
  “Imposter Syndrome”, which doubles as a feeling of loneliness.
</p>
<p>It would be interesting to note though, that I learned about perfectionism as an idea at a very late age. Not only it helped to learn more about it, but
I also learned about how some video game designs play encourage it by baiting people with virtual rewards.</p>

<p>
  Taking long breaks between each major output is essential for my recovery, without it, I would not have the energy to
  craft further. To this very day, I still question my French teacher’s behavior, I am overall thankful that my hands
  were trained to write nice and cursive text, which extended to me being capable of nicely drawing. I am aware that her
  and my people had pure intentions, some say that they also had the same circumstances or lived lives they didn’t want
  their children to experience. At the end of the day, I partially do this to impress, as my creations act as a positive
  feedback gateway for my satisfaction, knowing fully that what I made deserves the praise it keeps getting. Regardless of all of that, I will still keep doing my best to reach higher skies.
