<p>More often than not, I tend to scratch through my problems instead of ignoring them. If you are like me, you might routinely research ways around most if not all issues that bug you. This article will serve as a small wiki to communicate the many obscure tricks that I learned, either from someone else or by discovery. I will categorize them and potentially put detailed instructions on how to execute them. This article will never have a final version, I will keep updating it as I learn more.</p>


<h3>1 - Comfort</h3>

<h4>1.1 - carrying a non-empty backpack</h4>
<p>On average, I tend to seek to minimize my sensory effort as I spend my days doing my daily chores. These chores often have me go outside for lengthy hours and transporting myself from an area to another. Although unnecessary, I could have often chosen to go outside without a backpack, since some of these trips don't require none other than my presence, still, I always carry one containing items which I might not end up using.  </p>
<p>The value of this exercise lies within carrying a backpack, not for its items but to introduce a weight on my back, something that gives me some form of comfort by "walling my back"as I keep walking. It would be necessary to mention that not every backpack type may help here; it is also important to arrange your chosen items in a way that is perfectly aligned to give that "wall" feeling I mentioned. I use a grey "Traveling Rucksack" containing (Ordered from the back to the front) my backpack, drawing tablet, Sudoku book and knitting wool. When my back is in direct contact with the how solid my laptop is, I feel safe, elegant and balanced. I don't have any formula down here to help find the optimal weight that puts me in this state but it'd be up to you as you keep mixing and matching while also finding the correct order. </p>
<p>If you wish to read more into this, the term you should be looking for is "Deep pressure stimulation".</p>
