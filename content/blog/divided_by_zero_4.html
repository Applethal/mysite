<p>More often than not, I tend to scratch through my problems instead of ignoring them. If you are like me, you might routinely research ways around most if not all issues that bug you. This article will serve as a small wiki to communicate the many obscure tricks that I learned, either from someone else or by discovery. I will categorize them and potentially put detailed instructions on how to execute them. This article will never have a final version, I will keep updating it as I learn more.</p>


<h3>1 - Comfort</h3>

<h4>1.1 - carrying a non-empty backpack</h4>
<p>On average, I tend to seek to minimize my sensory effort as I spend my days doing my daily chores. These chores often have me go outside for lengthy hours and transporting myself from an area to another. Although unnecessary, I could have often chosen to go outside without a backpack, since some of these trips don't require none other than my presence, still, I always carry one containing items which I might not end up using.  </p>
<p>The value of this exercise lies within carrying a backpack, not for its items but to introduce a weight on my back, something that gives me some form of comfort by "walling my back"as I keep walking. It would be necessary to mention that not every backpack type may help here; it is also important to arrange your chosen items in a way that is perfectly aligned to give that "wall" feeling I mentioned. I use a grey "Traveling Rucksack" containing (Ordered from the back to the front) my laptop, drawing tablet, Sudoku book and knitting wool. When my back is in direct contact with the how solid my laptop is, I feel safe, elegant and balanced. I don't have any formula down here to help find the optimal weight that puts me in this state but it'd be up to you as you keep mixing and matching while also finding the correct order. It would be however necessary to prioritize the solid objects with the highest width first, in my case that would be the laptop, this ensures better space management in the back and allows for more items to be packed if needed. But whichever order you go for, don't be this guy:</p>

<p>If you wish to read more into this, the term you should be looking for is "Deep pressure stimulation", googling this term alone gives links to topics that are not focused on what I discussed quite earlier, but adding the term "backpack" to the queries leads to the label "Sensory backpack", I can't recommend a specific article on it, I read some and they are all valid and correct.</p>



<h3>2 - Management/Organization</h3>

<h4>2.1 - Always ask for more time before making decisions through the phone</h4>

<p>Writing E-mails always felt easier than vocally communicating context because writing always came with the added ability of editing my speech as I built sentences, which means that I had to worry less about the final version of what the ideas that I wish to transmit. On the phone however, I often deal with speech difficulties, which add more weight on my decision making; most of my phone interactions had me make decisions to fulfill requests. My impulsive people pleasing nature forgets that I am given a binary choice, hence why I accept any demand regardless of my current status, which eventually leads to burnout. </p>
<p>Under well established management, it is often the case that E-mail based decision making comes with buffer times. Should you receive an E-mail, the sender does not expect an immediate response. Unlike phone calls, this offers enough time for me to check my calendar and health situation before proceeding. As the subtitle suggests, we want to have this feature on when dealing with phone calls. It is quite often the case that the people demanding your services expect the possibility of receiving a no, it is a request after all and no order. This can be remedied by simply requesting to have some time to think and responding back. Alternatively, you may ask to have your requests E-mailed to you to gain the temporal advantage.</p>

<p>Remember that requests are kickstarted using expressions questioning the possibility of having them fulfilled, it is often not imperative to respond positively. Always ask for more time to think, then analyze whether the mental and temporal resources at your disposal are sufficient enough to conduct the said request.</p>

<p>Small note here about pushy people: Although this snippet focuses more on teaching you the aforementioned trick, I wish to put some accents on a subset of people that is often labeled "leeches". The way these types communicate their needs makes it sometimes hard for us to consider refusing to help them, heck we may go up and beyond to prioritize their needs over ours. I had cases where refusing to aid these people were met with comments on how selfish I am. Remember that you are a limited human being with finite resources that require replenishment every now and then, this will be the third time I write this: Always ask for more time to rethink your options and never forget that it is okay to say no.</p>



<h4>2.2 - Always request progress bars</h4>

<p>Lengthy tasks with unknown deadlines or roadmaps can cause (me) anxiety, the more information I have, the more calm I remain. Having vision over my current state, where I am heading and what I had prior gives a sense of control. It diminishes the stress that comes as a result of thinking when will this end? Something that I often experience with lengthy and repetitive tasks. aprox. 7 years ago, I was asked to check a folder full of excel sheets, the number of which was unknown as they kept coming every day, meaning that I was not dealing with what felt like a finite number back then, I was asked to look through each line and find the many errors that may have spawned. Looking through the sheets was quite painful as I never knew when will this task end nor was I aware of my current position; although it motivated me to invest more time writing macros than doing the task by hand, I wish if I had an idea about when it would end so that I can move to the next task.</p>
<p>The reason anxiety arises in this area is because of our desire for predictability. Having timeline-consciousness makes it easy for us to organize our schedules and next moves. Seeing what we achieved prior to our present state gives a sense of pride and a reason to celebrate a productive day.</p>


<h3>3 - Communication</h3>

<h4>3.1 - In doubt, always ask for/agree upon definitions</h4>

<p>One frequent communication barrier that often transcends linguistics is interpretation. I can not count how many times I had people accusing me of doing something I never did, or having people think I was exaggerating. In my positions, I often attempt to correct the facts, these attempts usually end up failing or succeeding depending on the party I am facing. I somewhat learned to train my reflexes on inviting the party to agree on the defining the action described in the accusation before making any denials or confirmations; I am not a perfect man and I may indeed make mistakes (Maybe they are right), however, having a common understanding eliminates most of the emotional weights that I often carry when having arguments, since I (and I know many of you) would rather prefer justice and fairness over anything. Having these agreement in-fact may even protect us against false accusations and reduces gaslighting and scapegoating. This is a technique you might need to employ against unfair people that often have bullying tendencies, as they usually from what I have observed, they often have good word play in an attempt to initiate some lies. Small rule of thumb here: If the person accepts the invitation, then it certainly means that they are communicative and do not seek speech arguments dominance, which is a good sign for someone who is deserves respects.</p>
