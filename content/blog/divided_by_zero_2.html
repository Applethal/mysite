<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber">The skinner box</a> is an psychology experiment
  that further
  explores operant conditioning. Simply put: Behave well and you will get rewarded, choose the wrong option and you will
  get punished.
  Be it humans or animals, any entity would always seek to maximize our utility function. Honestly I wish this analogy
  was used
  in the artificial intelligence resources that I used. </p>

<p>As we grow up, we shape our knowledge base and keep learning to enhance our future interactions through the
  experiences we gain.
  Part of the learning process is to make mistakes (Or watch people do mistakes), since they lead to nothing but
  punishement, since rewards feel
  temporary in comparison to the pain attached to choosing the wrong dialogue option.
</p>

<p>As far as interactions go, I like to picture them as branch and bound models, where each root node has up to N
  options. If you overthink much, chances are, you tree will be transformed in a non-tree graph where some decisions
  might lead to a loop. Having trees with a high number of options might lead to decision fatigue, extending all the way
  to decision avoidance A.K.A. I ain't doing that. </p>

<p>Everyone loves smooth and swift communications, navigating decision trees is a daunting task. I often envy those who
  can quickly sort themselves out through it. One way to heuristically deal with this is to reduce the amount of options
  that you
  have to deal with, each experience that you gain acts as a cache in your memory, allowing you to reduce the length of
  the tree by
  seeing patterns in your daily life. Paradoxically enough, with experience, you end up learning new branching paths and
  new
  options to choose from. Skilled manipulators tend to have intelligently designed trees; psychopaths however tend to
  have multiple trees instead, one
  for each profile .
</p>

<p>After all, I find it crucial for every human to learn and gain as experience as they can. I observed that the
  punishement
  factor of taking the bad options tend to be lighter the younger a human is; as you grow, people would often presume
  that
  you are capable of measuring and designing good decision trees. It's an important skill that some people make money
  off of nowadays, most departements have an advisory bureau, ready to enrich your trees with all the solutions you can
  afford. This is important as life is filled with many surprises that you can't really quantify.

<h2>Is stochasticity beautiful ?</h2>
<p>Real life is filled with randomness. In such environments, it becomes harder and harder to calculate your moves, let
  alone set
  an objective function as the number of dimensions grows exponencially, which is why people study psychology. </p>

<p>Growing up in Morocco offered me an environment with tons of variables to deal with.</p>
