<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operant_conditioning_chamber">The skinner box</a> is a psychology experiment
  that further
  explores operant conditioning. Simply put: Behave well and you will get rewarded, choose the wrong option and you will
  get punished.
  Be it humans or animals, any entity would always seek to maximize its utility function. Honestly I wish this analogy
  was used
  in the artificial intelligence resources that I used. </p>

<p>As we grow up, we shape our knowledge base and keep learning to enhance our future interactions through the
  experiences we gain.
  Part of the learning process is to make mistakes (Or watch people do mistakes), since they lead to nothing but
  punishment, as rewards feel
  cheap in comparison to the pain attached to choosing the wrong dialogue option.
</p>

<p>As far as interactions go, I like to picture them as branch and bound models, where each root node has up to N
  options. If you overthink much, chances are, you tree will be transformed in a non-tree graph where some decisions
  might lead to a loop. Having trees with a high number of options might lead to decision fatigue, extending all the way
  to decision avoidance A.K.A. I ain't doing that. Having anxiety may also lead to the latter in a way that hinders your
  calculations, heck it might
  even introduce some negative weights to the reward associated to the option that is, in practise, the most rewarding
  one. </p>

<p>Each node in the graph denotes the state of the situation, whereas the edges represent the decisions. Each state has
  an objective function that is to be maximized,
  or minimized; this function can quantify anything (Ex: Patience, love, strength, energy...etc..), it all comes down to
  your imagination.</p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:grey; font-size:small;">Negotiating a trade, yes I usually give up easily, hence why
  my tree's depth is short.'</p>

<p>Everyone loves smooth and swift communications, navigating decision trees is a daunting task, it prompts me often to
  rely on muscle memory and instinct, something which I usually train by creating simulations in my head, hoping that
  their interactions will be 1:1 with what I picture. I often envy those who
  can quickly sort themselves out through it. One way to heuristically deal with this is to reduce the amount of options
  that you
  have to deal with, each experience that you gain acts as a cache in your memory, allowing you to reduce the length of
  the tree by
  seeing patterns in your daily life. Paradoxically enough, with experience, you end up learning new branching paths and
  new
  options to choose from. Skilled manipulators tend to have intelligently designed trees; psychopaths however tend to
  have multiple trees instead, one
  for each profile.
</p>

<p>After all, I find it crucial for every human to learn and gain as experience as they can. I observed that the
  punishment
  factor of taking the bad options tend to be lighter the younger a human is; as you grow, people would often presume
  that
  you are capable of measuring and designing good decision trees. It's an important skill that some people make money
  off of nowadays, most departments have an advisory bureau, ready to enrich your trees with all the solutions you can
  afford. This is important as life is filled with many surprises that you can't really quantify. It is expected of an
  adult to be ready for the
  many possibilities that they may encounter.
</p>
<h2>Is stochasticity beautiful ?</h2>
<p>Real life is filled with randomness. In such environments, it becomes harder and harder to calculate your moves, let
  alone set
  a proper objective function as the number of dimensions grows exponentially, which is why some people study
  psychology. </p>

<p>Growing up in Morocco offered me an environment with tons of variables to deal with. On top of reacting to what I
  would see. To ensure my survival, I would still require something beyond the so called sixth sense. This is one of the
  reasons that motivate my coming to Germany, yet still, Germany also has some RNG to fight against but the probability
  range is a bit slim in comparison to my country. This is alluded by the fact that the law governs over everyone,
  however, humans are not perfect as entities, they might make some exceptions if they feel the need to.
</p>

<p>As human beings, we try to minimize the luck factors by tackling the many situations using logical connectors.
  Initially, when dealing with randomness for the first time, the set of possibilities is \( \Omega = \{P_1, P_2, N_1,
  N_2.....P_n, N_n\}\) where \(P\) and \(N\) are a depiction of the positive and negative consequences
  respectively. Each element of \( \Omega \) has its own chance that ranges from \( [0, X] \)
  where \(X\) is an unknown upper bound to the possibilities that can occurs. As we keep learning about the variables,
  the \(X\)
  gets minimized until it reaches 0, meaning the consequence can never happen. Due to the unpredictable
  nature of living on earth, \(\Omega\)'s set is always subject for changes. Altering the RNG range challenges the
  intelligence of the human. As they move forward, it slowly reshapes their problem solving, risk management and
  strategic planning... </p>



<p>One strategy to fight against the RNG is to join a community. People commit to build small communities where they
  share their experiences and expand each others' knowledge base, which is often to be archived for existing and passed
  to the next generation. But what if those communities pretty much have no knowledge to back you up ? Job searching is
  one environment where you will often hear people say "Just try your luck! and see if you can land a job". </p>

<h3>Job search, also known as: Recruitment hell, for a reason. </h3>

<p>Job search is an environment where you can't concretely state a chain of moves that you can follow in order to reach
  your goal. It is subject to competition, the state of the economy, your expertise and even sometimes the mood of the
  HR...And many other corners that I am failing to perceive as we speak.</p>

<p>Oddswise, the RNG set can be reduced to \( \Omega = \{Refused, Accepted\}\), this is true because of how
  imperfect the recruitment processes are, as you can't objectively make a guide that
  leads you to victory. Getting accepted would have you flip a coin against every obstacle, fail once and you're out,
  and thus the following describes odds of both
  outcomes, where n is the number of job application obstacles that the applicant has to deal with:

  \[
  Refusal = P_r

  \]

  \[
  Acceptance = (1- P_r)^n
  \]
  \[
  \quad n > 0
  \]


</p>

<p>Because of how limited our POV, as job seekers, we would prefer to hear the opinions of a professional, since their
  reputation is often succeeded by cutting down the RNG upper bound by a huge margin. One such problem that encourages
  this behaviour is how obscure the floodgates that everyone has to deal with when applying for a job.</p>

<p>Because of the stochasticity of this whole endeavour, sometimes you might receive opinions that might damage your
  RNG, what's worse is that you can't really tell. Like when someone told me to remove the picture from my resume,
  saying
  that it's unnecessary. While the latter is true in the US, I was later told by many experts that this is not the case
  in Germany. </p>

<p>It sucks that the orthodox ways of sending an application nowadays tend to lead to bad results from what I heard.
  This sadly impacts the mental health of anyone outside the loop. As people become slowly desperate, they slowly
  discover new
  tactics to add to their action set, like reaching out directly to an HR, or getting connected through a network.
</p>

<p>As of the writing of this article, many companies are slowly embedding artificial intelligence as an automation
  obstacle
  against the high number of applications that are attempting to net an interview. I am failing to see if this
  will kill the HR positions, though I'll still be interested in seeing the upcoming shitstorms.

<h3>Seeking a roof: the worst they can say is no</h3>

<p>
  August 2022 marks the day I was told that my old home was sold and that I (we) had till December 2022 to leave the
  apartment. By this time, a war happened in the east of Europe, which negatively impacted the economy and the
  demographic stats in the west, something which also played a role in making it extra hard for me to seek a new home.
</p>

<p>Small spoiler here: I could stay despite the limit, but I was operating under some horrible living conditions, which
  make me
  and many question how I could still survive for that long. Hearing the news from the house owner motivated me to look
  for a better place after living there for aprox. 2 years. So even though I had the option to stay, this whole thing
  made me feel desperate for a new roof.
</p>

<p>Unlike Job seeking, the randomness here felt less punishing so to speak, as I could somehow sight the obstacles.
  Ideally I would prefer to live with the right people to maximize my survivability. Sadly I had to deal with the
  sudden demographic explosion, inflation, and some other unseen features that I will soon discuss and talk about. </p>

<p>Naturally, as a student, my options -In theory- were a bit vast, since I had access to services that welcome students
  much more
  than regulars. I had budget constraints, and I also had to wisely pick the people that I would live with.
</p>

<p>Winter was approaching, I had to be active, as pretty much anyone who posts online about having a free room tends
  to receive tons of notifications, it makes me wonder how I would deal with it if I was in their position. The more
  I kept failing to find a place, the more I slowly kept increasing my budget threshold. I also had to deal with
  scammers,
  which sadly do exist and will for certain take any chance to scheme on me. The best I could do was to set an
  automation
  mechanism that sends a message to everyone who posts online right when their room goes available.
</p>

<p>I mentioned that I would have to seek people to live with, though I did not mention anything regarding
  being compatible with them. This was a bit problematic, since I would have to mask in order to receive a chance
  at being accepted. Some would love to party all day, some would love to try my dishes....And there is me, who just
  wants to
  routinely be a student.
</p>

<p>There is of course, the other option of networking yourself out in order to find a clique to live with, an option
  that sadly wasn't available for me at the time since I barely built any relationships in my first 2 years of living in
  Germany.
</p>

<p>I am writing this article from my new home, in a room bigger than the kitchen I had. Had I not asked an acquittance
  of
  mine for help,
  I probably would never be able to blog this out. My link to this person was purely professional. Normally, getting in
  here
  would require me to meet certain requirements, and receiving the privilege from this person was something I would
  never expect. I would never forget this and I would always be thankful for it. </p>


<h3>Getting the visa</h3>

<p>I don't have much to say here, this is somehow comparable to job seeking. Since you are dealing with unseen variables
  which somehow led to many into creating phantasies on the topic.
</p>

<p>Normally, to apply for a visa, I would have to submit my documents and see the magic happen. More often than not,
  getting a refusal
  comes dry with no feedback or remarks that hint towards the decision, which is why people keep speculating on the
  matter, to the point that I heard things like: Make sure to smile properly in order to have a chance.
</p>

<p>Without the feedback, it becomes a bit difficult to plan your next moves, especially if you are desperate and
  want to alter the outcome RNG.
</p>



<h3>Side note: The dangers of living in a routine</h3>

<p>I highly appreciate structure routines. Under normal conditions, spending my days feels like meditating, as
  I have nothing to worry about, as long as I take the proper measures and as long as I stay responsible with things
  like
  paying bills and being on time with my appointments. It really
  feels good to be ignorant and face everything as I plan, I feel elegant and smooth in this state.
</p>

<p>Relying too much on a routine, passively makes me sometimes forget and undermine the uncertainty of accidents
  that can occur in my daily life. Though I do my best to stay away from these, I am not a perfect being.
</p>

<p>As much as I appreciate all the good moments that I had in my life, I sometimes wish if I could systematically
  tackle many challenges instead of relying on any sort of luck factor in order to succeed.
