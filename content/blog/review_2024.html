<p> It's the affirmative content season, said my algorithms. Every 2-3 scrolls I get videos online telling me how great my n+1 year will be, informing me about the piles of money that I would get and the shiny love partner that awaits me. In all seriousness though, 2024 and 2023 felt the same, but I am however ending this year with some victories, which I a gladly would like to talk about in this article.</p>


<p>By the time 2024 began, I had 3 main things in mind: Looking for an internship to finalize my studies, working on a scientific work for the said studies and working on my website. The former was quite draining given the lack of deterministic features that would allow me to organize my next plans, the scientific work had me challenge my creativity in order to come up with something with no references or inspirations, whilst the latter was something that I could use to escape all the pain associated to the grinding. This phase took aproximitly a \(\frac{1}{4}\) of the year and was flavoured with some nostalgia featuring <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digimon_Tamers"> Digimon Tamers</a>, the soundtrack of which was quite soothing while I was fighting with overleaf to compile my work. Having said that, the constant crashes and the aggressive premium plans of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overleaf">Overleaf </a> motivated me to seek an offline medium, which led me to use <a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(text_editor)">Vim</a> combined with <a href="https://github.com/lervag/vimtex">VimTeX</a>, of course I had to learn Vim but it was no challenge to my fast fingers, because VimTeX is offline and super fast, I completly ditched Overleaf and started to do everything locally. This arc had me head back to Morocco for a week after mom kept telling me to consider hunting for a plane ticket; given my finances and as I found one costing me about 60€, I had no valid excuses to refuse, I had to deal with the warmth and comfort of having a routine and having had already traveled there made it less difficult to mentally accept the trip. It was nice to see the family after not having them around for more than a year, I wish I could have spent more time but the internship search was quite annoying. After heading back to my room, I registered myself for a diversity networking event, something which my university psy-therapist recommended with the hopes that I can find something.</p>





<p>I presented the scientific work on April and was successful. It felt good to see that I could manage to pull this one off and I consider myself lucky in this area to be quite honest. To put it shortly, I simply thought of transforming a custom vehicle routing problem into a knapsack problem, it was quite fun! The difficult part of this entire thing was enduring room 32-147, which had a cooling machine that kept running until 18:00 with the purpose of allowing the servers to catch some air (or so I believe); no amount of noise-cancelling can help against it and luckily for me, I obtained a laptop to be more mobile after 4 years of studying with no laptop. One week after the presentation I got sick and had my body traumatized, prompting it to cause an inflation in my foot, right where a spider bite it. Of course I learned from my mistake back in 2023 and went straight ahead to treat it, which took 6 needles and a week of rest. I sent an application to register myself for a scientific project in the field of combinatorial optimization once again, which was positively accepted, I had to ready myself for a greater challenge now. Meanwhile, as I kept it going with the networking event, they had us go through some coaching sessions, which had me get lots of takeaways, the first of which is that my resume is already good enough; it went through more than 10 iterations of changes in terms of content and design, this feedback convinced me that as long as I convey clear and structured information, then it's already good enough. The second feedback is something that I will surely use everywhere for the rest of my life, something which I knew the theory of yet never dared to apply as a result of society's pressures: Unmasking. This latter statement is quite counter-intuitive considering the argument that I just brought up, it felt really good to be myself and somehow I asked myself: Why should we keep ourselves oppressed? To this very day I always present myself with a disclaimer, espcially in non-casual environment. I can never thank this coach enough, I recall he also wished if everyone would be themselves but it can sadly never happen given the <a href="https://applethal.com/blog/divided_by_zero_3/"> parameters</a> under which we live in.</p>


<p>The finale of the event had me travel to München for 2 days. I sought assistance with the booking and solving of logistics-puzzles, I then heard about the booking gimmicks and some horror stories about staying in a hostel. Usually before any major trip, I try to discover some new music to download and listen to, but this time I sticked to my old files. Using the train was quite refreshing, and upon arriving, I had a cheap panic when I saw billboards promoting the football season, which was going to happen in Munich. I panicked because I didn't know that Munich is the english word for München, thinking that I might have booked the wrong train. Luckily for me that was not the case, and the event was just a couple of steps away from the train station. My mobile phone's compass was always broken and unreliable, I had to find directions by asking. I was satisfied overall with the first day of the event, the weather was quite hot back in those days and my hostel room had a couple from Australia who came to chill and have fun in the football season. During those two days I didn't consider a tour in the city due to many constraints. The best takeaway I had from the event though was when I met a representative who said: "Don't be ashamed of asking for help, and if you do, 99% of the time people would help you!". When I came to Germany, I was always put down by many for asking for help, which was quite discouraging and made me build some negative philosophies around this matter. What that person said made me reconsider my approaches and gave me lots of relief. The event allowed me to connect to 3 companies, and I am super thankful for everything they managed to organize, I am in fact still in contact with some of their members and I am super happy that I got to partake in this. </p>


<p>When I came back from the trip, I resumed the pause in order to tackle the project, which had a tricky combinatorial problem. To my very luck I had some support, which came handy in the right moments, especially when I had some moments of weakness due to a mixture of various issues coming from many corners. We both could manage to successfully jump through many hoops, something which genuinely boosted my confidence, allowing me to even use my creativity in the production. Somehow I discovered in August 2024 a room at the universtiy where I can connect my laptop with a monitor, allowing me to be even more productive. The room was usually empty, and had no bass boosted fans that wreck my head, now I can blend in with the mathematicians! August had me feel more nostalgic, sending me back in time to when I started watching <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ranma_%C2%BD">, so I downloaded the entire discography of the series and enjoyed the moments. </a></p>
