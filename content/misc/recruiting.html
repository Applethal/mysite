Summary: Saad vs the machines

<p>In 2017 I began playing lots of Pokemon gen 7's random team matches in the Pokemon Showdown website. The idea of building a team was something I did not consider until watching lots of videos on how the meta works as of that generation. The complexity of making a team raises exponentially as we keep moving generations. As of generation 7, the number of possible combinations is a \(\binom{809}{6} = 382197543688324\), next you have to pick 4 moves for each of these 6 chosen team members, the space of which depends on which Pokemons you chose, you then pick an item out of approx. 500 holding items, you then choose an ability out of a maximum of 3 for each of the 6 chosen mons, and finally you adjust their stats by allocating 508 stat units across 6 different stats, all of which (except for Shedinja who has a locked HP stat of 1) can at most have 254 stat units. And if you so wish to include the gendering, nicknaming and shinyness then that makes the problem even more complex. There is a whole lot of min-maxing involved here in building a team here, especially with the additional constraint that limits which team members you are allowed to pick in a usage-based bracket, which depicts which pokemons you are not allowed to choose.</p>

<p>Considering all of these dimensions leads usually to a headache due to the non-convexity of the problem, hence why people rely on observing the common patterns in the meta, which usually consists of picking the mons with the highest base-stats and best offensive/support moves. I always wanted to have an all-around team, yet I wanted something that offers surprises, something that stands-out, a team that only a few may know how to respond to. </p>

<p>I loved gimmicky pokemons, especially ones that are versatile, the likes of Mew and Smeargle, the former of which can be taught any TM and comes with superior stats than its rival. Smeargle here outshines Mew because it can learn any move, and most of the good moves -in my opinion- are inaccessible via TMs. Smeargle is often seen carrying hazard moves, which funnily enough I don't use. I usually lead with Smeargle, unless the opponent has a magic bouncer (Thanks, team preview). It carries the following moves:</p>

<code>

artist (Smeargle) @ Choice Scarf  
Ability: Own Tempo  
EVs: 252 HP / 4 SpD / 252 Spe  
Timid Nature  
IVs: 0 Atk  
- Spore  
- Switcheroo  
- Imprison  
- Transform

<p>This smeargle is meant to break the pace. If I successfully switch my Choice Scarf item, that is meant to lock the opponent's moves. I immediately use Spore-> Imprison -> Transform, the first 2 moves are somewhat impossible for Mew to learn, though as of Gen 9, Mew learns imprison yet still has hypnosis as its best sleeping move. Smeargle is meant to disrupt the flow of initiation. Most of the fights usually begin with setups from what I noticed, and Smeargle is there to hinder them. The best scenario that occurs is when I lock the first opponent, then they switch to another team member that I instantly put to sleep, out of frustration the opponent switches then to a third pokemon if they refuse to stay in the field and resist sleeping which often takes 2 turns at worst. Imprison locks the opponent from using moves that are shared with the user, if used before transforming, it prevents the opponent from using a move, causing them to struggle. </p>


<p>Xatu had two partners since 2017, Serperior and Shuckle which both carry the ability Contrary, that reverses the effects of stat changes for the user. Xatu's role is to either provide backup for the team by reducing incoming damage with the barriers, or if kickstart one of my favourite improvised strategies. Xatu has the hidden ability magic bounce, his main role here is to give this ability to the opponent's mon with Skill Swap, in the next turn, a Contrary user comes in and boosts its evasion using moves that would decrease the opponent's evasion. Years ago, I ran this with Serperior with defog, he would use it to boost evasion by one stage. The problem with serperior is that it is a glass canon, it is very squishy here. I ditched it for the more bulkier Shuckle, who learns Sweet Scent, which would raise it by 2 stages. The issue with preferring this over Defog is that, while it raises the evasion stat by one stage, Defog has no accuracy check. I have had cases where I would have to use Sweet Scent multiple times in order get my precious x3 evasion boost.</p>
<p>Sometimes I would send Shuckle first before smeargle if the opponent already has a magic bouncer. My opponents typically sent their magic bouncer to initiate the combat, only to realize that they should not have. I usually laugh when I see how my opponents switch out right after I use their abilities to boost my own evasion. Alas, Xatu may come into play sometimes to scare off, making them expect offensive moves, a common trait for Sucker Punch users. It reserves Thunder Wave in its 4th move slot just in case I encounter someone who has its speed boosted, a move that has a 10% chance to fail. If these very same opponents have also their attacking stats boosted, then sending Shuckle after passing Magic Bounce, makes me favour going straight for evasion boosts without the need to trap them with infestation, as they would rather keep the stat boosts they have vs taking the risk of missing their attacks. PS: Always run a shiny Shuckle, that blue coloring makes it looks so beautiful!</p>

<p>I do not have much to say about Mega-Alakazam, my stall-focused team requires a sweeper. Energy Ball is for coverage as I saw lots of Water users, some of which tend to run Swift Swimmer which I gladly copy with Synchronize to give myself more speed. Psyshock is there not only for STAB but also against physically defensive mons. Dazzling Gleam and Shadow Ball are for coverage. Its role used to be filled by Mega-Szizor, who dominates in the physical end. The replacement happened because Alakazam has better movepool coverage-wise, and that Szizor even with the Mega upgrade felt like it needs a turn just for swords-dance.

<p>The final member of my team is a Clefable running Unaware. Its role is to be the final wall before losing, I usually dispatch it when I detect a sweeper, as Unaware is the right response for this with how it ignores the stats changes of the opponents. I like how the average player thinks that I am running a Magic Barrier set with a fairy move, and I like it further when I boost my defenses with Cosmic Power as they keep wasting turns boosting their attacks. Flamethrower/Z boosted Fire is for the steel types. The Z Crystal is specifically there to deal with Ferrothorn, as Flamethrower is sadly not enough against its bulk. Clefable's type scares Dragon types with its presence on the field, which might mess up with setups.  </p>

<p>I made this one day before presenting my master thesis. The star of my team is Shuckle, I am biased only because I like how it looks like, though I appreciate the efforts of all of my mons equally. Notice how I lack a 6th member. The 6th slot was filled by Hitmonlee, Quagsire and Slacking. I could not find someone who might attract me with its stats and moves, who might have an iconic impact and maybe have good synergy with my team. The 6th slot maybe should be filled with someone who can counter a big chunk of the Overused pokemons list and yet be absent from the top to cause more surprises. I am still looking for you, and I hope to find you. </p>

<p>The reason I keep playing Gen 7 is because Game Freak took the brilliant decision of not including some of the moves and pokemons we had from the previous generations. I could not find a substitute for my strategies here and I would have to rethink everything and make things more modern.</p>
