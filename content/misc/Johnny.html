Summary: Saad vs the machines

<p>Years ago I saw a fancy artwork showcasing a birdification of <a href="https://guiltygear.fandom.com/wiki/Baiken">Baiken</a>. I liked it, wishing if someone did the same to <a href="https://guiltygear.fandom.com/wiki/Johnny">Johnny</a> or <a href="https://guiltygear.fandom.com/wiki/Venom">Venom</a>, my still most favourite characters of the series. I expressed my desire to see such beauty on twitter, only to be met with scammer bots, asking me to commission them in exchange of having my wish fulfilled.

<p style="text-align:center; color:grey; font-size:14px;">3 out of 4 bots in total vanished as of the writing of this article</p

<p>Fast forward today, I have my own tablet and skills, they aren't that sharp but it's a learning opportunity for me, especially since I had to master the anatomy of what makes a bird, a bird. </p>

<p style="text-align:center; color:grey; font-size:14px;">This one took 8 days</p>

<p>I didn't document the process of making this, especially since it wasn't challenging. I had to ask for a third opinion regarding the shading since I had lots of uncertainty. I was going to give Johnny his sword, only to realize that it might not look elegant given the posture of the bird, I decided to make it so that the bird would utilize its wings to slash instead, which honestly felt like a cool idea in theory. The hitboxes are added there just for the fun of it. I had to adjust the hat multiple times in order to correct it, it was funnily enough harder to adjust in comparison to the coat.

<p style="text-align:center; color:grey; font-size:14px;">I haven't given my guy the artistic justice he deserved</p>

<p>The idea of having stand on his pool stick was spontaneous, in fact, I just recently learned that his latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Ds4zgV8ZW4">GGST trailer</a> had a similar posture. The intention to make him pose like that had nothing to do with the video. The reason is in fact quite similar to why I decided against making Johnny hold his weapon. The suit part was quite tricky though, to simplify my task, I decided to make his sleeves bigger. The lower part though was a nightmare to modify, it originally began crooked, this is where I had feedback from multiple sources yet with barely any directions, only to be told: Just follow the normal bird anatomy, without any specific instructions. What you see here is the final product.</p>


<h2>Small disclaimer: As I keep aging, my hatred on how we use AI technology grows</h2>

<p>I do not hate AI, I in fact like the science and mathematics behind it, what I despise though is how greed makes humans use it for creative purposes, an intent which requires the said technology to be fed with stolen art in order to create newer output, which is akin to how humans get inspirations. Using AI to create new content has, objectively speaking, lots of negative consequences on the environment, economy and social levels; subjectively speaking, my bias makes me believe that it kills the soul of creativity. I never use it to create and I will never use it, I would rather teach myself the skills necessary to build what I desire, rather than employ a soulless entity. Alas, the reason I am writing this is because, if you open your eyes wider, you might notice some vivid distortions on the last picture. What you see there is a result of using an AI poisoning tool that is meant to confuse AI models into seeing something other than the naked eye sees. It saddens me that my hatred for this technology led me to seek such pre-cautions, as this slows down my production. I could go full-Buddha mode and care less, since I made this website and its content mainly for myself and expect nothing in return, but my justice/moral driven actions make me think that what I am doing is for the best. It kind of feels somewhat insulting that someone decided to sniff my creation in order to lead the world to its doom.</p>

<p>The tool I used is called <a href="https://nightshade.cs.uchicago.edu/whatis.html">Nightshade</a>. This is not the first time I see effort being made into poisoning AI's training. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEDFUjqA1s8&t=3s">This is another honorable mention</a>, which is meant to hinder plagiarism. You could argue that this in fact hurts the user experience, as it makes it difficult for people with hearing disabilities to consume YouTube videos properly. Until then, I will keep hoping for a better future. I would love to see a timeline where this ends or gets reduced, I like how AI is being used for fruitful goals like early-cancer detection, but to use it and steal content without even honoring the creators is innacceptable.</p>
