Summary: My very first Monster Hunter weapon design submission

---


<p>One of my favourite aspects of the Monster Hunter franchise is the weapons design and the culture of weapon smithing. 1 week prior to the making of this, I saw a post online for a weapon design contest and wanted to submit something I always had in mind, yet haven't seen anyone speak about it (To the best of my knowledge). I will be presenting here the final design without speaking much about the process of making it, I would however drop a neat thing that I wanted to implement, yet could not achieve its making due to various reasons </p>

<p>The switch axe is a weapon that utilizes user input to store energy and release it in the form of a big explosion, this small detail is enough to potentially allow for various design gimmicks that revolve around the usage of coils, since these can be used to transmit current through electromagnetic induction, I wanted to make it so that the coil would display itself getting hot as the user charges their zero-sum discharge. As I began making a "sword-coil" I halted right before beginning to color it, right before that moment I asked myself: How can we make a coil morph into an axe? </p>
<p>If you explore the various Monster Hunter weapons, the notion of having a weapon serving the purpose of another is nothing new here, the cheapest example to look for can be found in Monster Hunter Generations where there are various long swords having the design of a sythe. This means that I would only be restricted by my creativity! I gave up at the end as I could not think of any axe designs that mirror the coily design of the sword. Hence how I came up with what you see down there: </p>

<p>The light bulbs are not there just for decoration. In sword mode, the bulbs will light up from the bottom all the way up as the user charges the zero-sum discharge, successfully countering in sword-mode makes them flicker. In axe mode, using the heavy slam attack makes the light bulbs light on and off from as long as the buff is active. The Battery life indicator on the weapon is tied to the switch gauge, it empties as you keep swinging the sword and fills up as you swing the axe. The yellow lanes were a last minute addition, I added them to make the axe look less boring. </p>

<p>Whenever I see this work and think of flickering lights, I think of my alarm in the morning, hence the name. </p>


<p>Regarding the sound design, some "din din din" sound effects tied to the light bulbs would be a really nice addition. I really wish if I could finalize the coil sword idea, As of the writing of this article, I still have some time to make this, who knows? </p>
