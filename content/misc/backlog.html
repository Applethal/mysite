<p>Quite often, especially at night, I get creative ideas that burn me with passion. Sadly, the majority of such get
  stuck in a W.I.P. phase or -even worse- do not end up being executed. This is usually the case due to routine
  constraints, which is part of what makes an adult, my important priorities exhaust my energy and by extension my time,
  making it sometimes hard for me to consider the said ideas.

  <br>
  With proper planning, I may end up setting up the conditions necessary to start the execution, but sometimes I may
  reach obstacles that I can not heuristically solve. This post will list everything that I wished to make happen, it
  will contain its backstory, logistical excuses on why I could not (as of yet) execute the idea, and finally I will
  propose a process to help organise myself. This post will be actively updated as I keep getting ideas:

  <summary>Drawing a mixture of famous cartoon cats surfing together -- Status: Pending </summary>
  <article>

    <p>Years ago and specifically in my third week in Ergotherapy, to train the dexterity of my hands and teach myself
      focus, the therapy woman proposed that we start with a painting activity. Back then, I haven't had any painting
      chores since more than a decade. I had little to no support on how to paint but I had no limit on what I could
      paint, the role of the woman was to aid me with my cognitive focus, nothing more nothing less. I used only my
      intuition to
      help myself on the creative part, I needed a background, and the easiest thing that I thought about was to take
      the blue colour and paint the sky, then I had the sudden idea to see if I can paint <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garfield">Garfield</a> in a surfing position,
      then few minutes later, I thought about adding <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_and_Jerry">Tom</a> and
      as I was progressivly tinkering, I
      thought about adding more cats from other media... And that's how the idea was born.. Except I could not finish
      the painting in time. I always daydreamed to achieve this on a digital plane, and all what I would require is a
      tablet...
      And maybe some skills. </p>


    <p>As of the 12th of Nov. 2024, I do not, sadly have the means to draw digitally at ease, as I can not rely on
      the mouse (even though I reckon its feasibility). The cheapest and best option I can do is to see if I can afford
      a graphical tablet, and reserve some time slots for this, maybe 2 hours max a week. The goal of that Ergotherapy
      exercise was to teach me that I don't have to do everything in one go anyways. </p>

    <p>As for the process, since getting a graphical tablet would be a long time investement, I think it would be best
      if I teach myself how to digitally paint using the tool and then start with the official execution. Time
      constraints should not matter here as I can reserve the 2 hours on the weekend and be happy about it. As of the
      writing of this entry, this would be the final roster: Garfield, Tom, <a
        href="https://typemoon.fandom.com/wiki/Neco-Arc">Neco Arc</a>, <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvester_the_Cat">Sylvester</a> and <a
        href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nyan_Cat">Nyan Cat.</a></p>
