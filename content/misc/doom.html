Summary: Recreating a scene I had in mind and can't find anymore

---

<p>Since my childhood, I had a deep affection towards shoot em ups and bullet hells. It all began when one of my parents got me a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neo_Geo">NEOGEO</a> emulator contained in a cd. Back then, because emulating these devices came with the benefit of inserting an infinite amount of virtual coins that can be generated with the press of a button, I never cared about achieving high scores or finishing a Danmaku with 1 coin, A.K.A. 1CC-clears, nor was I afraid of trying each time I reached a gameover.
Years have passed, with the advent of the internet, I was exposed to the magical world of the reason why a small subset of people choose to get into the bullet hell leaderboards. It takes lots of dedication and pattern memorization to climb those ladders. Other than their unique visuals and the music theory of their soundtracks, each time I successfully make it far in those leaderboards, I like to picture myself as the pilot with the small hitbox, trying to surf/dance myself through the rain of bullets that attempt to end my runs.</p>

<p>Bullet hell is sadly a niche that is hard to access, making so that the average person consumes only the artistic part of what they offer. Approx. 3 years ago I stumbled upon an artwork of <a href="https://touhou.fandom.com/wiki/Marisa_Kirisame">Marisa</a> from the Touhou series, riding her broom and trying to navigate the air to beat another character as she dodges bullets. I sadly have lost the image, leaving me no choice but to go through my twitter timeline to find it, something which may cost me hours and hours of digging. That picture felt so majestic, showing Marisa looking at the other character with a smile, displaying her confidence in her ability to victoriously survive the outcome. Having this picture burned into my mind made me consider making my own version, this time using a depiction of mine, riding the very same broom, except this time, I would face Evaccanneer DOOM instead. </p>

<p><a href="https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Evaccaneer_DOOM">Evaccanneer DOOM</a> originates from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ketsui:_Kizuna_Jigoku_Tachi">Ketsui</a> series. Due to how niche the series is and due to how inaccessible shoot em ups are, finding lore surrounding this monster makes me fantasize about many of its aspects. Beyond the fact that it was made by the villains who sought profit using the third world war, Evaccanneer DOOM is nothing more than just a final challenge and a last resort for EVAC to end the journey of the pilots. During my timeline, I could manage to reach it only once, I however never bested it. Seeing its in-game render made me think that it was made after a moth due to how its jets produce the firy effect of its wings, so much so that each time I see a real life moth, the track <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zzPuPQKGtEU">NO REMORSE</a> from the Dodonpachi remixes plays in my head. That track alone puts more accent on the feeling of danger that is often portrayed in that genre of games. When looking however at its official concept art, it makes me think that it was intended to be seen as a beetle instead. The mysteries behind its design leaves me no choice but to make interpretations, as the Ketsui series was last active in 2012, the designers left no mentions or documents that would aid me to learn more about everything I questioned. </p>

<p>This entire thing took 2 weeks and it displays my development in artistic works, especially in the area of perspective. The only time I felt I needed to check up a reference was when I tried to draw Evaccanneer DOOM, everything else was drawn from my head.</p>


<h1>Week 1 - First attempt </h1>


<p>My very first attempt began in a Cafe on a rainy day. Back then, I was careless thinking that it would be sunny, since the morning of that saturday was quite warm (approx. 26 CÂ°), this one took an hour. I took this picture and sent it to a friend with the caption "Samedi soir ruined". Samedi soir refers to my routined saturdays, where I go to the park and stay there with a book and podcasts on my headphones. Now back to the topic, in this attempt, I drew DOOM from memory, and tried to add bullets with some tracking rockets. </p>

<h1>Week 2 - second and third attempt </h1>

<p>As I made some corrections and remade DOOM after looking at some official art, I took a tuesday to color everything, only to receive feedback from a friend saying that I should work on my perspective. After thinking for long, I realized what's wrong before receiving the explanation; some of the front bullets do not have realistic propotions from an horizontal point of view, as when I made the trail lines, I focused more on the verticality of the bullets. Speaking of which, I bit one myself and decided to rework the bullets the next day, something which I often find hard to accept, since reworking things tend to make me sweat, but honestly, I am happy I did so and followed his advice, the results of which is as follows:</p>



<div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="/dodge/doom_ver2.png">
</div>
<p style="text-align:center; color:grey; font-size:14px;">Attempt 3! Bullets corrected</p>



<p>I realized that the bullets look cleaner when I removed their outlines. I wish I added more rockets to offer extra layers of dangers, because 5 on a small screen are never enough. Coloring the sky however was a challenge on its own, I decided to use a dark environment with a gradient. In Ketsuipachi, as DOOM emerges from the debris, the sky turns reddish, something which I failed to recreate, as it made some of the big bullets and rockets harder to notice. I ended up using a "cotton" tool in Krita on the bullets to create a visual trick that make the bullet seem as if they are traveling at a fast speed.</p>

<h1>Week 2 - final version </h1>

<p style="text-align:center; color:grey; font-size:14px;">Final version</p>

<p>The decision to add a lock-on crosshair on the head came after a meal I disliked this Friday. It was originally using a brighter green, the same friend from a couple of paragraphs ago gave the suggestion to reduce its opacity or even make it look blury, an idea that I liked myself. What I ended up not liking though, is how cartoonish the rockets look like, a detail I noticed at the very end of the making. This scene is supposed to bring terror upon seeing it, and with those rockets in mind and the "low" amount of bullets on screen, I feel at ease. Alas, I am quite happy with all what I went through to make this, as well as what I ended up creating at the end.
I however wish if I could find that aforementioned Touhou artwork, if I ever do, I might make another version that uses that artwork as a basis.</p>
