<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/Rust/">Rust</a> is a video game that puts lots of emphasis on survival that deserves to be a case study for those psychology
    adepts. Its core gameplay is to gather resources, whether it's by collecting, fighting or stealing. If you would
    pass by
    a stranger, their first thoughts
    often sinister as no one trusts each other. </p>
<p>
    Rust however was not a game for me, heck I did not even buy it, I
    won it in
    a
    fighting game tournament back when it was in its alpha, and back when I had a computer that was not capable of
    running
    it. Even after obtaining a new computer, I could not properly enjoy it on my own, and by pure accident, 2 of my
    people
    went into Rust to discover it, seeing how it had the fame of creating fun and moments of joy, moments which were
    very
    costly. Just like any PvP based survival game, enjoying the hours that you burn into gathering the resources is not
    free, especially since you are put in a stochastic environment: RNG seeded maps, servers populated with a wide range
    of
    people from the mushroom pickers and the pros who wall the PvP difficulty, the mechanics...etc..
</p>
<p>
    I became the third of the pack, and as predicted, I had to deal with entoxicating idea of having to collect the
    precious
    metals and protecting them. By the time I started my first hours, I had no SSD, which was required to fight against
    the lags, something which prompted me to focus less on combat since my system was not capable of handling fast paced
    reactions, my role was then reduced to indoor organizing
    and farming the resources that we needed as a team, and in rare occasions participate in group scouting.
</p>

<p>
    Although I had little impact on our growth, I still enjoyed hearing my team mates being happy about what they did
    despite my absence in the battle field. Until I discovered one day that you can craft a wooden plate and put it as a
    decoration.
</p>

<p>You see, the core gameplay obscured me (and the players, of course) from sighting these smaller features, "greed is
    good" some people said. Still, once I put one of these plates on the wall, my first thought was to use it as a label
    for our boxes... Until my boredom played its role and I started toying with the colour palette, which by the time
    was very limited
    for stupid reasons:</p>

<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 50px;">
    <img src="../rust/colors.png" alt="">
    <p style="color: #888; font-size: 14px;">The original rust colour palette</p>
</div>

<p>Painting in rust was challenging, starting a session was spontaneous ,and more often than not I would have difficulties deciding on what to paint due to the limited colour palette and bad mouse tracking, and let's not forget about potential disturbance coming from the opponent players as well as my team mates if they need assistance. Ah, one last thing: Rust's painting module has no eraser, if you make one mistake, you either have to live with it or completly start over, and if you are an artist, you know where this is going... </p>

    <span class="dot" onclick="currentSlide(2)"></span>
    <span class="dot" onclick="currentSlide(3)"></span>
</div>

<p>At any rate, despite all of this, I enjoyed racking hours into this small niche of a hobby. I do recommend doing it in a proper server and not in one of those combat focused server. As of today, the only update that we could benefit from was a new colour palette, I am not sure how hard would it be for them to add an eraser, but since only a small purcent of people paint in rust, no amount of petitions would bring this feature to life.</p>
