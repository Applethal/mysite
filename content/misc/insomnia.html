Summary: NO DESCRIPTION YET

---


<p>Due to a combination of genetics and the environment where I lived (and some other factors outside my knowledge base), I always had trouble sleeping in peace. These were much more extreme in my teen hood, I complained to my father on the matter and every time he came up with a hypothesis, one such theory was that my brain shares the characteristics of a dolphin, making it so that half of its brain stays awake during sleeping times. I am not sure if I should take this as a compliment though, knowing that dolphins are smart, likeable, and sometimes not worthy of our trust according to some cultures.</p>


<p>In the recent years I started to like horror works that tend to make incarnations out of the abstract, much like the silent hill series, cry of fear, the kill the past series and the evil within. These tend to have the common theme of having their characters placed in situations where their past hauntings tend to manifest as demonic and unnatural characters.
</p>

<p>Last night as of the making of this post, I had a sleepless night until 6:00 in the morning. To save up on my sleeping pills stock, I usually take half a pill only when I know that I have important events, as stress caused by overthinking is a major factor that hinders my ability to join the dream world. This overthinking often jumps from a topic to another, and no good amount of changing positions or calming music aids against it. I accepted it as part of my neurological features. Upon waking up I remembered what my father said about dolphins and I spontenously decided to make what I am about to present. I made it in aprox. less than an hour, it is rushed but I like it! </p>


<h3>Basis layer</h3>

<p>At first, I wanted to fuse both dolphin limbs together with a brain. I then somehow got the idea of only having half a brain attached to these. The idea was inspired by the aformentioned horror works, as they tend to form their incarnations based on a past event or how their characters tend to perceive the said incarnations. </p>

<h3>The second layer</h3>


<p>I had to teach myself on how to draw a brain in 3 dimensions, which was not that hard

<p>I could go far and make it look horrifying. Insomnia is something that I definitly do not enjoy dealing with, and taking those sleeping pills makes it sometimes really hard for me to wake up. Rare are those times where I benefit from being mentally crippled in those moments. The overthinking goes intense every time I am challenged in my daily feats; in these phases I tend to simulate the many possibilities that I may have to face in the future, hoping for a solution against these difficulties. Somehow whenever I get a good idea against these, I tend to spend the night happily praising it. I hope that one day I'll have non-artificial ways to sleep as how it should be.</p>
