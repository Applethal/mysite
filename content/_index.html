<h2>Good day!</h2>

<p>I may go by many names but my true name of power is <strong>Saad</strong>.</p>

<p>I keep shifting my hobbies. If you are here, chances are: Either you are a fan, or someone who wants to check me out,
    at any rate, you are welcome!</p>

<p>This is my personal website, where I share with you the things that I love to talk about.</p>

<p>Expect different topics to be published in the blog section. The recommendations page will contain things that I have
    consumed and liked, ranging from food to media content. The sandbox will have some of my fun
    implementations, all of which will be open source. If I find nice things to hang here that do not fit in any of
    these categories, then the miscellaneous page will surely be a fine home for these.</p>

<h2>About me:</h2>

<p>I am a Moroccan student residing in Germany since quite some time. I am a guy who doesn't stick with one thing as I
    like to learn different things, though my specialization is operational research / combinatorial optimization. Other
    than that, I have an artistic eye which I often use whenever I find the chance.</p>

<p>I like typesetting and writing, I have been writing <a
        href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Applethal/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides"
        style="color: yellow; text-decoration: none;">guides</a>

    and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Applethal/recommended/"
        style="color: yellow; text-decoration: none;">reviews</a>
    since quite
    some time, and I have been thinking about making a website since a couple of months ago. What you see right now is a
    revision of a design that was claustrophobic. I like minimalism and this website will be based upon such philosophy,
    there will be no ads and no tracking.</p>


<h3>Cultures that I support:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The right to repair</li>
  <li>The right to own</li>
  <li>Balanced minimalism</li>
  <li>Digital media perseverance </li>
  <li>Healthy innovation </li>
  <li>Accessibility</li>
</ul>
