<h2>Good day!</h2>

<p>I may go by many names but my true name of power is <strong>Saad</strong>.</p>

<p>I keep shifting my hobbies. If you are here, chances are: Either you are a fan, or someone who wants to check me out,
    at any rate, you are welcome!</p>

<p>This is my personal website, where I share with you the things that I love to talk about.</p>

<p>Expect different topics to be published in the blog section. The recommendations page will contain things that I have
    consumed and liked, ranging from food to media content or even people. The sandbox will have some of my fun
    implementations, all of which will be open source. If I find nice things to hang here that do not fit in any of
    these categories, then the miscellaneous page will surely be a fine home for these.</p>

<h2>About me:</h2>

<p>I am a Moroccan student residing in Germany for quite some time. I am a guy who doesn't stick with one thing as I
    like to learn different things, though my specialization is operational research / combinatorial optimization. Other
    than that, I have an artistic eye which I often use whenever I find the chance.</p>

<p>I like typesetting and writing, I have been writing <a
        href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Applethal/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides"
        style="color: yellow; text-decoration: none;">guides</a>

    and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Applethal/recommended/"
        style="color: yellow; text-decoration: none;">reviews</a>
    since quite
    some time, and I have been thinking about making a website since a couple of months ago. What you see right now is a
    revision of a design that was claustrophobic. I like minimalism and this website will be based upon such philosophy,
    there will be no ads and no tracking.</p>

<p>$$Max \space Z: = \sum\limits_{j \in J} d_j.w^k.X^k_j + \sum\limits_{p \in J}
    d_p.w^k.X^k_p$$</p>

<p>Subject to:</p>

<p>$$ X^k_j \leq 1 \qquad (\forall j \in J) $$</p>

<p>$$ X^k_p \leq 1 \qquad (\forall p \in J) $$</p>

<p>$$ w^{k+1}_j = X_p . w_p + (X_{j-1} . (w_{j-1} - 0,1 )) \qquad (\forall j+1 \in j) $$</p>

<p>$$ \sum\limits_{j \in J}\sum\limits_{p \in J} X^k_p.d_j + X^k_j.d_j <= D \qquad (\forall J,p \in J) $$ $$ w_p=1
        \qquad (\forall p \in J)$$ $$ X^k_p, X^k_j \in \{0,1\} $$ $$ w_p, w_j \geq 0$$</p>
