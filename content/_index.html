<h2>Good day!</h2>

<p>I may go by many names but my true name of power is <strong>Saad</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are here, chances are: Either you are a fan, or someone who wants to check me out,
  at any rate, you are welcome!</p>

<p>This is my personal website, where I share with you the things that I love to talk about.</p>

<p>Expect different topics to be published in the blog section. The recommendations page will contain things that I have

    consumed and liked, ranging from food to media content. The sandbox will have some of my fun
    implementations. If I find nice things to hang here that do not fit in any of
    these categories, then the miscellaneous page will surely be a fine home for these. I like minimalism and this website will be based upon such philosophy,
    there will be no ads and no tracking.
