<p>Hello, My name is Saad. I was born in Morocco and I reside currently in Germany. Before 2020, if one would
  ask me what my expertise is, I would fail to respond with anything fancy. The average person phantasises about my
  hacking shenanigans after they sight me printing a string in the console. I am no hacker, in fact, my expertise lies
  in combinatorial optimization, a subset of mathematics that is filled with lots of puzzles to solve. I like how
  challenging it is as a domain. I feel at home when I consult its science, in fact, even prior to me living in Germany,
  my mom used to complain about how I spend lots of effort on calculating the right options, hinting that I love the
  idea of making the best decision and choosing the right thing. Had I had my hands on a time machine, I probably would
  be the engineer that I always wanted to be. I am glad though that I live to have something that I enjoy learning
  about.</p>

<p>Hobby-wise I endulge in anything that allows me to maximize the fun factor of my daily life. I can never properly
  list the hobbies that I went through since my childhood. Digging deeper in many topics allows me to transfer my
  knowledge and my experience to other corners, which allows me to skip the many hours of training a person may have to
  go through. </p>

<p> Despite me jumping from hobby to another, one consistent thing that I have not interupted yet was typesetting and
  writing, I have been writing <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Applethal/myworkshopfiles/?section=guides"
    style="color: yellow; text-decoration: none;">guides</a>

  and <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/Applethal/recommended/"
    style="color: yellow; text-decoration: none;">reviews</a> since aprox. 10 years. Sometimes I may lose my sleep to
  excitement upon getting a new idea, I am not sure if I should complain here, but if this results into something that
  would eternally be published and remembered for, why should I? In short, you may consider that I am a wizard of sorts.
</p>

<h3>Cultures that I support:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The right to repair</li>
  <li>The right to own</li>
  <li>Balanced minimalism</li>
  <li>Digital media perseverance </li>
  <li>Healthy innovation </li>
  <li>Accessibility</li>
</ul>


<p>I am glad that I was born in the 90's, I had the privilege to live in a time where consumerism was not heavily
  weighted by capitalism. I deeply invest myself into the "Right to repair" and "Right to own" cultures, since their
  ideologies were something that I went through, and I dislike how we as a society are slowly losing these rights. I do
  my best at spreading the words of my cultures by encouraging their practices. When
  it comes down to accessibility, I am talking here about breaking the many barriers that are honestly unecessary to
  have, this targets even the -purposefully- complex scientific papers or the many acrobatic hoops a person has to go
  through in order to cancel a subscription. I believe the world would be a better place to live in if we applied these
  principles. </p>



<p>The iceberg image is a depiction of the many layers my persona has to offer. I try my best to be open and keep things
  on the surface, but I am just a human being, and it's natural for our kind to contain some secrets. Will you stay in
  the surface? Or
  equip your diving suit? The choice is yours.</p>


<p> I have seen people using music as a way to describe themselves. This is especially true since music is something
  everyone consumes, its nature allows people to get connected. On average, people measure their personalities using
  music. It
  feels good to meet an acquaintance who shares my
  taste. I can't however give a general image on what I listen to, but you could say that I try to listen to multiple
  genres. </p>
