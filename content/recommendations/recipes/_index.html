Artists - independent of context - love to experiment. To provide fresh commodities, creatives explore their search
space,
which is sadly often constrained by a set of rules indoctronated by the human race. In the context of food, the
theoritical search space
is finite, it is subject to the raw resources of the earth. Although I can't quantify an upper bound for the solution
space, I believe this would do a fine job as an introduction:

\[
\prod_{i=1}^{11} X_i
\]

Let \(X_i\) be the decision variable that expresses the quantity of using a raw material.

<p>
    1. \(X_1 : M \quad (\text{Meat})\)<br>
    2. \(X_2 : F \quad (\text{Fish})\)<br>
    3. \(X_3 : V \quad (\text{Vegetables})\)<br>
    4. \(X_4 : FR \quad (\text{Fruits})\)<br>
    5. \(X_5 : G \quad (\text{Grains})\)<br>
    6. \(X_6 : D \quad (\text{Dairy})\)<br>
    7. \(X_7 : L \quad (\text{Legumes})\)<br>
    8. \(X_8 : NS \quad (\text{Nuts and Seeds})\)<br>
    9. \(X_9 : H \quad (\text{Herbs})\)<br>
    10. \(X_{10} : S \quad (\text{Spices})\)<br>
    11. \(X_{11} : B \quad (\text{Beverages})\)<br>
</p>

With respect to:
\[
X_i \geq 0 \quad \text{for } i = 1, 2, \ldots, 11
\]



It is basically a combination of every thing that I could think of, maybe there is another categorie to
speak of but you get
the gist of it. Still, researches came up with a long list of restrictions
that introduces cuts to make room for some feasibilty, you can't of course mix pepsi and milk or else you would end up
with a magical potion. Health is sacred!
