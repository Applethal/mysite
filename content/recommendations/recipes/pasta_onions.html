I was just roaming online until I hit a video that claims that the recipe is quick so I gave it a go!

<ol>
  <li> Contain the water in a proper heating medium
  <li> Boil water @ max temps
  <li> Put the pasta in the container and let it heat
  <li> Cut 2 onions 
  <li> Using a pan, fry them together with some butter
  <li> Cool the fried onions using some water 
  <li> Add 20 cl liquid creme to it
  <li> Add some salt, pepper and parmesan cheese to it and keep mixing 
  <li> mix the pasta together with the sauce
  
</ol>

I can't believe I pulled this off properly on the first try, it was delicious and took little to no effort. I guess the algorithm blessed me today with a nice recipe, else I would be
consuming my usual stuff. I am glad that this was a success as it boosted my confidence for more! I lost the video's link but I have seen people hinting towards the possibility of adding meat or thun fish to it.
I still think however that 2 onions were overkill here, as only a big one would be enough, maybe this is a craft for families. I don't see myself preparing this unless I have more time than what the Gantt chart says, it appears
that cleaning the pan after eating took more effort than what I anticipated due to how sticky the onions and the sauce was. I think the main product of this entire thing is the sauce itself, which I can maybe use for other 
recipes in the future, not just pasta.
