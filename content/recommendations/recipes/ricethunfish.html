This fix stems from the east, my mom used to say that fish and rice are part of what makes Asia a strong continent. Pretty much every Moroccan that I knew mixed rice and thon fish, since the latter was pretty much accessible -Perks of living in a country with 2 seas-.


<ol>
  <li> Cut the onions and potatoes
  <li> Contain the water and boil it in 2 slots @ max heat
  <li> Cook the rice in one of the slots
  <li> Put the potatoes on the other container
  <li> Mix everything together

</ol>

I did not specify which spices to use here but I suppose this is not compatible with everything. Not only this is a quick fix on its own, but it's also good for those who train on an active basis, the rice and fish combo contains lots of protein and can substitute meat if the budget does not allow it. Somehow it tastes better under the effects of hunger.
