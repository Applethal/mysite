<h2 style="text-align: center;">Here I will be posting a glosary of tools that could use some exposure. These won't be
    sorted though but I will make sure to attribute the proper category to each of these.</h2>



<details>
    <summary>Latex tools</summary>
    <a href="https://visualmatheditor.equatheque.net/" target=”_blank>Visual math editor:</a> This tool helped me
    passively learn
    typesetting math equations in Latex. It's free and is something that I highly
    recommend, it has a GUI that runs on the math environement.

    <summary>Design</summary>
    <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" target=”_blank>Adobe's color wheel:</a> Although bloated, I
    still recommend
    this
    since it packs lots of options to choose from. You can pretty much use this not only for web design and art, but
    also for fashion. It sort of eliminates the need to seek someone with experience.

    <summary>Audiophile</summary>
    <a href="https://squig.link/" target=”_blank>Squiglink's database:</a> This website is more than a database for
    everything headphones related, it also has a tool which showcases the best equalizer setups for pretty much every
    headphone available if you want to make corrections. It comes with a tutorial that I find super user-friendly, which
    is a plus!

    <summary>Traveling</summary>
    <a href="https://bahn.guru/" target=”_blank>Bahn guru:</a> GERMANY ONLY. This website sniffs the train costs for you
    without gathering any data or cookies from your devices. It's simple and very minimalistic without any ads or
    whatsoever.
    It sadly fetches the data for the German lines only, but it's great as a tool for planning your next trip.

    <summary>Quality-of-life improvements</summary>
    <a href="https://wiki.futo.org/wiki/Introduction_to_a_Self_Managed_Life:_a_13_hour_%26_28_minute_presentation_by_FUTO_software" target=”_blank>Open source ways to self independence:</a> Louis Rossmann, one of my favourite people, made this great guide on how to minimize your dependence on many services that keep sapping your money while gatekeeping the how to do's of their methods. This guide is more oriented towards setting up smart media consumptions and privacy,  and is written in a way that even your grandma would understand it.
