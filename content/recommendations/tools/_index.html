<h2 style="text-align: center;">Here I will be posting a glosary of tools that could use some exposure. These won't be
    sorted though but I will make sure to attribute the proper category to each of these.</h2>

    <summary>Latex tools</summary>
    <a href="https://visualmatheditor.equatheque.net/" target=”_blank>Visual math editor:</a> This tool helped me passively learn
    typesetting math equations in Latex. It's free and is something that I highly
    recommend, it has a GUI that runs on the math environement.

    <summary>Design</summary>
    <a href="https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel" target=”_blank>Adobe's color wheel:</a> Although bloated, I still recommend
    this
    since it packs lots of options to choose from. You can pretty much use this not only for web design and art, but
    also for fashion. It sort of eliminates the need to seek someone with experience.
