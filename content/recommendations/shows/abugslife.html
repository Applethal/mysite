<p>
A Pixar classic, yet another movie that fails to bore me. Alongside Chicken run, my cousin gave me a VHS tape of a bug's life.
Of course as a child. I could not capture the hidden themes and messages that the movie conveys, as my perception was limited to
"The good guys suffer, the bad guys must be eliminated, the good guys find a solution and the bad guys perish.."
<br>
Either way, the more I keep watching it, the more I realize the pieces I've been missing... It makes me wonder if the plot, easter eggs and scenes would
stay the same if the movie was made today.</p>


<p>Visually speaking, the movie looks really good even by today's standards, the characters look astonishing as the movie tries
to project the perception of an insect and how they see the world. The soundtrack is memorable and well done.</p>

<p>I heavily relate to the main protagonist across the many dimensions of his persona. One could say that he is my comfort character.
Not only he, but pretty much every character was nicely written, as the setting is made in a way that humanizes the characters, giving
me that sense of familiarity.</p>


<p>In a similar fashion to <a href="../chickenrun">Chicken run </a>, the protagonists used unorthodox methods to
get rid of the villain, something which taught the child me to seek unconventional ways to solve problems.</p>


<p>Without spoiling much about it, I highly recommend this movie to pretty much anyone. It's a 10/10! </p>
