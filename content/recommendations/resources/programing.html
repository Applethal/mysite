<h3>When it comes down to self learning, videos often challenge my lack of patience, readable resources are a preference
  in this case. Everyone highly recommends learning
  by doing when it comes down to programing. In the following table, I will put together all the resources that I have
  used to shape my programing skills. If you work more on your algorithmic skills, learning syntax becomes nothing more
  of a chore. I am never in a rush and I am happy with my progression so far.</h3>


<h3>The table is scrollable. </h3>

      <td>I like how Python acts as a nice introduction to programming, when I wanted to start learning C++ for fun, I
        had difficulties finding a resource that helps with learning the syntax. This learning program, however, does a
        good job at that. You may start here but it, as of today, still lacks a chapter on Object-oriented programming.
        You can breeze through it in 5 days since it is aimed at people who are familiar with Python.</td>

        first page. They offer a wide variety of tutorials in various languages, though I believe they focus a lot on
        the syntax. It's a very good source to learn web developement or pretty much anything
        since they have a way to display the output of your code.</td>

Use Neetcode's roadmap as a starting point, although it is interviews oriented, it's very structured and organized.</td>
