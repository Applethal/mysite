<p>This book helped me become much more fit in the domain of linear programming. It is super beginner friendly and I actually might end up recommending it over <a href="../introduction_to_operations_research/"> this </a> if you want to go straight to linear programming, as this one focuses on the latter while the previous book I mentioned offers more fundamentals. Its sommaire is well structured and I could quickly navigate to the content that I need without being lost in its pages. It contains various examples that can be sighted in the challenges presented in the industry.
