<p>I don't have much to say about this book, it is very user friendly as it goes as far as containing
    the prerequisites that you need to grasp its information. It comes with many handy examples and figures to help you
    visualize the data, which is a huge plus! <br>
    It is so extensive that it makes me question if the title of the book is real.

<p>I honestly picked it up for linear programming, yet it managed to catch my attention with all the extras it offers. I
    highly recommend it for anyone wanting to get into OR topics. </p>
