            that it would contain the things that I love. Though my choice of hobbies is moody
            <br> and my interests are finite, I awate no visitors on my end.

            The Blog was created today! everything you see here was built from scratch. Because having a access to
            social media accounts is sometimes <br>
            is not enough.


            <br>I shall allow myself to start this chapter with this beautiful image. I highly recommand reading the
            article. Lady bugs are lovely and <br> in various cultures
            they represent luck.

        <h4> I do not think that showcasing pictures of how the webpage evolved would be enough to express the
            sentimental side of
            this achievement. As of 2023, it is trendy to spend less effort in order to receive more output, anyone
            could walk in
            and google their ways into finding a service that provides them an easy way to build a website. I chose to
            differ and
            do everything from scratch for the sake of contributing to my ego's well being.

                <h4> After learning CSS, I decided to tackle Javascript, so far I learned how to manage user input and
                    let the visitors submit
                    their entries. One thing that caught my attention was a memory of me encountering some old websites,
                    I then thought about visiting my
                    kid self and presenting him with this prompt above, where I ask him then to write his name and the
                    web page would say
                    Hello coupled with his name. The posibilities are infinite, though I expect him to be amazed and ask
                    how this works, would it be a good
                    idea to tell him that I, his older self, did this ?

                <Label id="myLabel"> Enter your name:</Label>
                <br>
                <input type="text" id="myText">
                <button type="button" id="myButton">Submit</button> <br><br><br>
                <br>
                <h4 class="date"> <u> 08/04/2023</h4>
                <h4> I spent more hours digging deeper in Javascript. So far I could grasp the syntax and I could not
                    find anything
                    interesting to speak of. I just wanted to mention that just like the other things that I grind, I
                    tend to absorb the information
                    and instead of following a typical learning process, I tend to be more creative and make my own
                    exercises instead, which may or may not sometimes
                    be a good idea.
                    As we speak I finished the if statements lesson, it took about 2 hours of learning to reach this
                    level.
