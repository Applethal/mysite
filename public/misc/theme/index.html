<p> I love colors that stem from the hot corner of the color spectrum, from red to purple. My mom used to forbid me
  from wearing these due to her associating these with femininity, constraining me to wear things that are "men-coded".
  I fully comprehend where she is coming from, in fact, there is a study that backs up her opinions; for instance: Brown
  and purple are part of the problem solver color scheme, however, choosing to wear everything in purple and black gives
  an air of mystery. My closet contains a mixture of red, orange, pink and purple colors; I never thought about why I
  like these colors, but if you inspect
  the science of color psychology, I believe this combination should allow me to radiate myself as a person, after all, they say that 
  your looks tell a lot about you, though I wish this would not be the case, it sadly works. All in all, feel free to wear anything you want, as long as it ensures your comfort!
<br> Throughout time and space, I could not sadly find a perfect resource on color psychology, as each source I came across has some inconsistencies, something which prompts me to believe that this is one of those topics that are subject to the human perspective.
Because of this, I believe the best approach to deepen my comprehension on the matter is to try to explore characters that wear a similar colour pallete, and then explore their psychee's similarities. This article 
brings up one such character, one that I discovered by pure accident, and happens to be quite obscure from the public due to the niche nature of its media.</p>


<p>I love the character <a href="https://azurestrikergunvolt.fandom.com/wiki/Lola"> </a> from the gunvolt series, I
  liked the idea of a robotic figure that heals entities using her music. Her model's colour palette matches
  her energetic personality. You could say that I am her n°1 fan but I don't think I deserve the title. I wish if Inti's
  budget allowed them to expand upon her story, though if I could choose a favourite song, you might want to listen to
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p9888TqD7xg">Original chord </a>.
</p>


<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="/sticker.png">
  <p style="color: #888; font-size: 14px;">My RoRo sticker on my laptop</p>
</div>


<p>Stickers of her character sadly do not appear to be available or even existing, and even if they did, I would presume
  them having prices that I can not afford. Both of these reasons pushed me into seeking some DYI solutions, which I
  ended up applying using <a href="
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eiUN7zUL0TE">this tutorial </a>. With 5€, a computer and some patience, I think an 1
  hour (Considering the trial and error I had to go through) was worth it, not only for the sake of the craft, but also
  to train my hands around its making.</p>


<p>Next is my Arch linux splash screen. I can hardly accept to use an OS without customizing its visual elements, even
  as a person who puts emphasis on minimalism. I was ready to go as far as spending hours in order to learn how to craft
  at least a splash screen, and so I decided to learn QML, which is essential for the making of splash screens without
  downloading any third-party software + honestly it was not that hard to deal with syntax wise. The splash screen has
  RoRo's combat pod form spinning with the following text beneath her: 「リミターカット！ フルドライブ！」, which is the
  exact line she says when activating her anthem mode. The text roughly says "I shall cut my own limits! activating
  over-drive", a line which I deeply cherich before starting my productive endavours. The files of the splash screen can
  be found on <a href="https://github.com/Applethal/RoRo-KDE">my Github repo </a>. </p>

<div style="text-align: center; max-width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <video style="width: 100%; height: auto;" controls>
    <source src="/RoRo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
  <p style="color: #888; font-size: 14px;">RoRo splash screen</p>
</div>



<p>In that same repo, you will find a wav file containing that exact same line. Back when I was working on this theme, I
  could not find any rips of dialogues across all the entries in the series. I took aprox. half a day to rip the files
  and clean them, only to extract one singular line of dialogues. The file can be used as a start-up sound that can be
  played upon logging in. That sound puts even more
  feelings to the system. </p>


<p>Lastly we have the Theme colors, which are reserved for the bars, windows and folders. Back when I was working on my
  own color scheme, I happen to have updated my system with some new files that broke the entire project, as it was
  dependent on many libraries that had to adapt to the new Plasma 6 environment. It took me 2 days to accept it, I then
  bit the bullet and chose to download a similar theme, which is honestly superior than mine. The colors theme in
  question here is <a href="https://store.kde.org/p/1450418">Strawberry Quartz </a>, its color pallete matches exactly
  the one that RoRo. The best thing that I did next is to attach RoRo's combat pod image (See file taskbar.png in the
  repo) in the taskbar. </p>

<p>I have not mentioned the wallpaper so far. I could go hardcore and draw my own, but I don't posess the right material
  for the task. I ended up going for an official art piece as my log in screen. </p>


<p>There is one final thing that I wish I could do: Doing a paintjob on the laptop, but I don't think I have the
  dexterity for that. It would be cool to have it rocking a crimson.</p>
