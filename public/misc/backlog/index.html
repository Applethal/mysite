<p>Quite often, especially at night, I get creative ideas that burn me with passion. Sadly, the majority of such get stuck in a W.I.P. phase or -even worse- do not end up being executed. This is usually the case due to routine constraints, which is part of what makes an adult, my important priorities exhaust my energy and by extension my time, making it sometimes hard for me to consider the said ideas.

<br>
With proper planning, I may end up setting up the conditions necessary to start the execution, but sometimes I may reach obstacles that I can not heuristically solve. This post will list everything that I wished to make happen, it will contain its backstory, logistical excuses on why I could not (as of yet) execute the idea, and finally I will propose a process to help organise myself. This post will be actively updated as I keep getting ideas:</p>

<summary>Drawing a mixture of famous cartoon cats surfing together -- Status: Pending </summary>
<article>

<p>Years ago and specifically in my third week in Ergotherapy, to train the dexterity of my hands and teach myself focus, the therapy woman proposed that we start with a painting activity. Back then, I haven't had any painting activities since more than a decade. I had little to no support on how to paint and I had no limit on what I could paint, the role of the woman was to aid me with my focus, nothing more nothing less. I used only my intuition to help myself on the creative part, I needed a background, and the easiest thing that I thought about was to take the blue colour and paint the sky, then I had the sudden idea to see if I can paint Garfield in a surfing notion, then few minutes later, I thought about adding Tom, from Tom & Jerry, and as I was progressivly tinkering, I thought about adding more cats from other sources... And that's how the idea was born.. Except I could not finish the painting in time. I always to achieve this on a digital plane, and all what I would require is a tablette... And maybe some skills.  </p>


<p>As of the 12th of Nov. 2024, I do not, sadless have the means to draw digitally at ease, as I can not relay on the mouse (even though I reckon its feasibility). The cheapest and best option I can do is to see if I can afford a graphical tablet, and reserve some time slots for this, maybe 2 hours max a week. The goal of that Ergotherapy exercise was to teach me that I don't have to do everything in one go anyways. </p>

<p>As for the process, since getting a graphical tablet would be a long time investement, I think it would be best if I teach myself how to digitally paint using the tool and then start with the official execution. Time constraints should not matter here as I can reserve the 2 hours on the weekend and be happy about it. </p>
